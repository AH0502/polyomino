        <p> Compute the following sums:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>

        <p>
          Without actually adding the values, make a prediction for the 
          following sums:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <m>1+3+5+\cdots +11</m>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>1+3+5+\cdots + 41</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <m>1+3+5+\cdots +201</m>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          The expression <m>1+3+5+\cdots + 11</m> is another way of writing 
          <m>1+3+5+7+9+11</m>. We write enough addends to establish a pattern  
          and then the <m>\cdots </m> tells the reader that the pattern continues.
          The <m>+11</m> at the end indicates that the sum will end when the pattern 
          reaches <m>11</m>.

          Based on your work above, give a simple formula that can be used to 
          calculate <m>1+3+5+\cdots+(2n+1)</m> for any positive integer <m>n</m>.

      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          In the previous problem, <m>n=100</m> since <m>201=2(100)+1</m>.

    <title>Conjectures and Explanations in Mathematics</title>
    <p>
      Have you ever wondered how mathematics came into existence? A simple answer is 
      that people explored mathematical objects, like numbers or shapes, and noticed 
      patterns and consistencies. They then sought to convince themselves and others that 
      these patterns were not just coincidences but would have to occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we convince others? In mathematics, we start with basic axioms like the ones WHERE  
      and then use logic to demonstrate that our conjecture must follow. Once we prove a claim, it 
      is no longer a conjecture and is now considered to be a theorem. We can then add the theorem to 
      our toolbox and use it to demonstrate new claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this textbook is written for students majoring in fields other than mathematics, we will not 
      spend time developing proof-writing techniques. Even so, everyone can benefit from learning to 
      write clear and thorough explanations and demonstrations. Future teachers should develop the 
      ability to explain mathematics carefully and accurately, using words, pictures, and multiple approaches 
      that their students can understand. A future lawyer or business professional will use a different 
      style, but the practice of writing explanatory papers in mathematics will enhance their ability to 
      present and support arguments for their cases and proposals. As you write explanations, choose an 
      audience that makes sense for you--a student, a friend, a colleague--and use language appropriate for 
      that audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we write mathematical explanations and establish new truths? We usually let our reader know  
      what we claim and plan to prove. In geometry, we often accompany our explanations with a sketch on which 
      we have labeled with the names of points and/or variables for lengths so that our reader can follow our 
      argument visually. We do not assign numerical values to lengths as we do not want to limit our claim to 
      one example. EXAMPLE
