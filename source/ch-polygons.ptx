    <title>Exploring Polygons</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        In section <xref ref="sec-intro-explore"/>, we introduced three basic 
        principles about area, <xref ref="intro-explore-principle-areameaning"/>, 
        <xref ref="intro-explore-principle-arearect"/>, and 
        <xref ref="intro-explore-principle-areasums"/>. 
      Hopefully, you will agree that length should also be additive; namely,
      that if we extend a segment of length <m>n</m> by a segment of length 
      <m>m</m>, the resulting segment has length <m>n+m</m>. We restate that 
      below:

      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>C</m> is a point on the interior of line segment 
          <m>\overline{AB}</m>, then the length of <m>\overline{AB}</m> equals
          the sum of the lengths of <m>\overline{AC}</m> and <m>\overline{CB}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </principle>

      In this chapter, we will show how these principles lead to the area formulas 
      for other polygons and to the Pythagorean Theorem. Instead of being facts handed 
      down through the ages, we will have first-hand knowledge of why they hold and 
      how they fit with basic principles.
