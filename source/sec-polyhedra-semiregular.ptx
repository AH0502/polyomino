        <title>Defining Semiregular Polyhedra</title>
        <p>
            We now extend our collection of polyhedra by exploring what it means for 
            a polyhedron to be semiregular. Note the resemblance to the definition of 
            semiregular tiling.

                    A polyhedron is <term>semiregular</term> if it satisfies the 
                    following conditions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Every face is a regular polygon.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At least two polygonal faces have a different number of sides.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The arrangement of polygons at every vertex of the
                            polyhedron are the same.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The notation for a vertex arrangement of a polyhedron is the same as what we  
                    used for tilings. A cube would be denoted 4.4.4 because there 
                    are three squares meeting at any vertex of the cube.

                    Does the number 3 correspond to the shape of the face or the

        <title>Definitions</title>
        <p>
            In this section we discovered two families of semiregular polygons: 
            prisms and antiprisms. We can also create prisms and antiprisms which  
            have faces are not regular. In particular, the sides of a prism need not be  
            squares, they could be rectangles or other parallelograms. The sides of an 
            antiprism do not need to be equilateral. Moreover, the bases of a prism or antiprism may 
            be any polygon whatsoever.

                    A <term>prism</term> is a polyhedron consisting of two congruent parallel  
                    polygonal faces joined by sides that are parallelograms, often rectangles.

                    An <term>antiprism</term> is a polyhedron consisting of a 
                    pair of parallel congruent  
                    polygonal faces joined by sides that are triangles.

        <p>
            The two parallel congruent polygonal faces are called the <term>bases</term> 
            of the prism or antiprism. The top base may be called the <term>summit</term>  
            in which case the bottom would be called the <term>base</term>. We specify the 
            type of prism or pyramid by shape of its base so that the 
            prism with a <m>4.4.n</m>-vertex configuration is called an <term><m>n</m>
            -gonal prism</term>. Of course, we  
            can set a polyhedron on any of its faces. Sometimes the base(s) will be appear 
            to be at the ends of the solid rather than at the top and bottom.

            <p>
                The summit of an antiprism will be a rotated copy of the base 
                lying in a plane parallel to the base. A prism will not have this 
                rotation.

                            after the mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) although Francesco 
                            Maurolico stated the formula for regular polyhedra in 1537. Euler was 
                            a prolific mathematician who worked in many different areas of mathematics. 
                            In fact, if you search for Euler's formula, you will find other identities also 
                            named for him, notably the complex number identity, 
                            <m>e^{i\theta}=cos \theta +i sin \theta</m>, or its special case,
                            <m>e^{i\pi}+1=0</m>.

                        GENERALIZE TO ALL BIPYRAMIDS????
                        A hexagonal bipyramid looks like two hexagonal pyramids glued 
                        together at their bases to form a diamond-shaped solid. All of its faces 
                        are triangular. At two of the vertices, there are six triangles meeting at a 
                        single point, but where the pyramids are <q>glued together</q>, there 
                        are four triangles meeting at each point. INCOMPLETE!!!!
