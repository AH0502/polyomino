        <title>Defining Pyramids and Cones</title>
        <p>
            In this section, we will learn about pyramids and cones and how they are 
            related to prisms and cylinders.

                    A <term>pyramid</term> is a polyhedron which may have any polygon as its 
                    base but the all remaining faces are triangles that come together at a common 
                    vertex called the <term>apex</term>.  The <term>height</term> of the 
                    pyramid is measured from the apex to the plane containing the base 
                    along a line perpendicular to this plane.

                <p>
                    We name each pyramid according to its base. Thus, a triangular pyramid has 
                    a triangular base, a square pyramid has a square base, and so forth. Also, the 
                    apex of the pyramid need not be directly above the center of the base; in fact, 
                    the apex may not be directly above any part of the pyramid.

            In <xref ref="explor-rect-pyr"/>, we shall compute measurements for a 
            specific example, a pyramid with a rectangular base and three perpendicular 
            edges meeting at vertex <m>A</m>. If this exploration is done in class, your
            instructor may choose to assign different pyramids to different groups. If 
            this is the case, you will want to construct your pyramid very carefully so 
            that your pyramid can be assembled with other groups' pyramids to form a new,
            yet familiar, solid. Then we will be able to use this construction to compute
            volume.

            With both prisms and pyramids, formulas exist to compute the surface area of some of 
            the common types, but these formulas are often not necessary<fn>The tough part of
                computing surface area is determining missing lengths and altitudes. Some formulas 
                will alleviate the need to perform these computations.</fn>. If we can compute the areas of 
            each face, then the surface area is simply the sum of the areas of the faces. 
        </p>
        <p>
            How can we find the volume of the pyramid you constructed? If you and your classmates were able 
            to construct all three pyramids, it is possible, though challenging, 
            to put them together to form a rectangular prism. The three edges of the pyramid that meet at vertex <m>A</m> 
            are perpendicular to each other and thus the three faces of the pyramid that meet at 
            <m>A</m> will also be faces of the prism. Rectangle <m>ABCD</m> is a base not 
            only for the pyramid, but also for the prism. The prism and the pyramid also 
            share the same height, namely <m>CF=CG</m>.
            
            It is a fact that the volume of a pyramid is
            exactly one-third of the volume of the prism with the same stretch distance. Since we know that 
            the volume of a prism is <m>V=Ad</m>, the volume of a pyramid must be 
            <m>V=\frac{Ad}{3}</m> where <m>A</m> is the area of the base and <m>d</m> is the 
            stretch distance or height. In fact, this works for cones as well. The volume of a 
            cone is <m>V=\frac{(\pi r^2)d}{3}</m> since the area of the circular base is 
            <m>A=\pi r^2</m>.

                        Cut out the nets and fold each to create a rectangular pyramid, taping 
                        the edges as needed.

                            <shortdescription>Nets for three rectangular pyramids; two have a

                                Use the formula <m>V=\frac{Ad}{3}</m> to determine the volume 
                                of each pyramid. Note that two pyramids should be identical.

                                    Put the three pyramids together so that they form a 
                                    <m>3\times 4\times 4</m>-rectangular prism. How does this 
                                    demonstrate that the formula <m>V=\frac{Ad}{3}</m> holds for 
                                    this particular pyramid?
