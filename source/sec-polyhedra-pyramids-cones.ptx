            In this section, we will learn about pyramids and cones and how they are 
            related to prisms and cylinders.

                    A <term>pyramid</term> is a polyhedron which may have any polygon as its 
                    base but the all remaining faces are triangles that come together at a common 
                    vertex called the <term>apex</term>.  The <term>height</term> of the 
                    pyramid is measured from the apex to the plane containing the base 
                    along a line perpendicular to this plane.

                <p>
                    We name each pyramid according to its base. Thus, a triangular pyramid has 
                    a triangular base, a square pyramid has a square base, and so forth. Also, the 
                    apex of the pyramid need not be directly above the center of the base; in fact, 
                    the apex may not be directly above any part of the pyramid.

        <title>Measuring Pyramids</title>
        <p>
            In <xref ref="explor-rect-pyr"/>, we shall compute measurements for a 
            specific example, a pyramid with a rectangular base and three perpendicular 
            edges meeting at vertex <m>A</m>. If this exploration is done in class, your
            instructor may choose to assign different pyramids to different groups. If 
            this is the case, you will want to construct your pyramid very carefully so 
            that your pyramid can be assembled with other groups' pyramids to form a new,
            yet familiar, solid. Then we will be able to use this construction to compute
            volume.

            <title>Surface Area of Pyramids and Cones</title>
        <p>
            With both prisms and pyramids, formulas exist to compute the surface area of some of 
            the common types, but these formulas are often not necessary.<fn>The tough part of
            computing surface area is determining missing lengths and altitudes. Some formulas 
            will alleviate the need to perform these computations.</fn> Some of these formulas 
            use techniques that are
            beyond the scope of this course. However, if we can compute the area of 
            each face, then the surface area is simply the sum of the areas of the faces. 
            Working with nets can help us focus on measuring the surfaces.

        <p>
            As illustrated in <xref ref="fig-cone-surface"/>, the surface of a cone will 
            consist of two parts, the circle that forms its base 
            and a circular sector that forms the section connecting the apex to the base. 
            In the net for the cone, the center of the circular sector corresponds to the 
            apex of the cone and the radius of the sector corresponds to the 
            slant height of the cone. This slant height is measured along a line segment 
            from the apex to the edge of the base which meets the base at 
            an angle less than 90 degrees.<!-- To find the area of the sector, we note that 
            that <m>\frac{Area_{sector}}{Area_circle}=\frac{q}{360}</m>
            where <m>q</m> is the number of degrees in the sector. Letting <m>R</m>
            represent the radius of the sector, we can compute the area of the sector by
            <m>Area_{sector}=\frac{q}{360}\pi R^2</m>.
            <idx><h>sector of a circle</h><h>area</h></idx>-->
        </p>
        <p>
            The cone, pictured in <xref ref="fig-cone-surface"/>, has a circular base 
            with radius 3 and a vertical height of 6. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, 
            we know that the slant height is <m>\sqrt{3^2+6^2}=\sqrt{45}\approx 6.71</m>.
            The net for this cone consists of the radius-3 circular base and the shaded portion 
            of the larger circle. The fact that the circumference of the base matches the 
            curved edge of the sector enables us to find the central angle, approximately
            <m>q=6.71</m>of the sector. 
            The process of finding the angle and area of the sector is left to an exercise.

                    <p>
                        The volume of a pyramid is one-third the volume of a prism
                        with the same base and height. 
                        Thus, the volume of a pyramid is given by
                        <me>
                            V_{pyr}=\frac{A_{base}\cdot h}{3}

                        is the height measured along a vertical line segment from the apex
                        to the base. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly the volume of a cone is one third the volume of a cylinder 
                        with the same base and height. Since the base of a cone or cylinder is 
                        a circle with area, <m>A_{base}=\pi r^2</m>, the formula for the volume 
                        of a cone can be written as
                        <me>
                            V_{cone}=\frac{\pi r^2 h}{3}
                        </me>
                        where <m>r</m> is the radius of the base and h is the vertical
                        height when the cone is sitting on its base.

                accept and use without further justification, but in case you

                different ways to visualize this surprising fact. As you have

                        material companies. This exploration can also be viewed

                            the same base and height. Fill the pyramid (or cone) with 
                            water and then pour the water into the prism (or cylinder)
                            that has the same base and height. Repeat until the prism
                            (or cylinder) is filled. What do you notice?

                            Does this prove that the formula works in all cases where

                        In this demonstration of the relationship between the 
                        volume formulas of prisms and pyramids, this GeoGebra applet,  
                        created<fn>Golden, John, "Pyramids in Prism," GeoGebra Public

                        by John Golden, demonstrates how  
                        a <m>3\times 4\times 5</m>-rectangular prism into three 
                        rectangular pyramids. In this activity, the shapes are the same as in
                        <xref ref="expl-volume-recpyr-by-construction"/>, but the prism is 
                        pulled apart rather than built. The applet allows us to change the 
                        dimensions of the prism and pyramids to help us see that the formula holds
                        for prisms of other dimensions as well. A device with a larger screen is  
                        recommended.

                            are often distorted when we view three-dimensional figures on paper 
                            or computer screen.

        <conclusion>
            <p>
                These explorations show that, at least in a few cases, the 
                volume of a pyramid or cone is one-third that of the corresponding 
                prism or cylinder. A proof of this fact for all situations is beyond
                the scope of this course.

                                A triangular pyramid with a distance of 10 cm from apex to base. 
                                The base is an isosceles triangle with sides 13 cm, 13 cm, and 10 cm. 
                                Since the base is isosceles, its altitude passes through the midpoint 
                                of the 10 cm side. This 
                                pyramid is sketched in <xref ref="fig-SAR-pyr-base-isos"/> and the lengths of 
                                the sides of the base are given.

                            there appear to be a nice relationship between the surface

                            Make sure that your calculator is showing four or more digits 
                            after the decimal point. Is the ratio you compute a nice number 
                            or an ugly number? Is it familiar to you?
                        </p>
                    </hint>
                    <answer>
                        <p>
                            The ratio is 1.74178097104. There does not appear to be a nice 
                            relationship between the two surface areas. 
                        </p>      
                        <p>
                            In fact, the surface area due to the base(s)
                            will be related by a factor of two since there are two bases in 
                            a prism and one in a pyramid. However, the heights of the triangular sides 
                            are not the same as the stretch distance <m>d</m> of the prism, but
                            instead are <m>\sqrt{d^2+e^2}</m> where <m>e</m> is the distance from 
                            the centroid of the base to the edge joining the base to the face.
