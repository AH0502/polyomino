            I am lucky to have a sufficiently large set of Polydron pieces  
            which allow groups of students to snap equilateral triangles, squares, 
            regular pentagons, and regular hexagons together. Even so, building the
            isocahedron can be tricky for many students. Groups who do succeed in 
            this construction tend to be proud of their accomplishment and allow other 
            groups to use their construction for counting faces, edges, and vertices. 
        </p>

            I have made tagboard pieces available in my classes, especially for 
            <xref ref="sec-polyhedra-semiregular"/>. These have been less popular, perhaps 
            due to the small size of the triangles and need for tape. In the next section, 
            it is essential that the side length of each polygon be the same.

            An alternative for this exploration would be to provide nets for polyhedra 
            after students have discovered the number and types of regular polygons that
            can fit around a vertex. This is especially true for the icosahedron and 
            the dodecahedron.

            It is possible to use combinatorics to count edges and vertices. Some students  
            who may struggle with counting visually may appreciate a suggestion to try this. 
            Eventually, I hope to add homework problems encouraging this technique. If you 
            are interested, email me at <url href="mailto:tmagnus@rivier.edu"></url> and I  
            will work on it.

            The first exploration provides an opportunity to review terminology 
            from the preceding section before moving on. The task 
            <xref ref="Archimedean-construction-extension"/> may be done with plastic or stiff  
            paper polygonal pieces or you may choose to provide nets. This task may 
            also be omitted.
