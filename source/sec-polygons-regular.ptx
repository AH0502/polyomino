        Have you ever studied a tiling of a floor or a pattern on a quilt? In this  
        section, we will define a regular polygon and explore when regular tilings 
        can be used to tile the plane.

    In the very first activity, we created a tiling of a square using tetrominos. 
    In this section, we will consider tilings of the plane. Since the plane continues  
    infinitely, we will not be able to fully create a tiling, but we will be able to 
    build enough of the tiling to determine whether a tiling is possible.

        A <term>tiling</term> is a collection of closed polygons that cover a plane 
        (continuing infinitely in all directions) with no 
        gaps and no overlaps. A <term>monohedral tiling</term> is tiling that 
        uses only one shape, 
        a <term>regular tiling</term> is a monohedral tiling using a single 
        regular polygon as its tile. In a regular tiling, each side of a polygon 
        will line up perfectly with a side of an adjacent copy.

          Experiment with equilateral triangles, squares, regular pentagons, 
          regular hexagons, and other regular n-gons to determine which can 
          be used to create a regular tiling and which do not. What do you think 
          will happen with regular polygons with more than ten sides? Why?

          Perhaps you noticed that the vertex angle measure places a role in determining 
          whether a regular polygon can be used to create a regular tiling. This task will  
          lead you to determine the measure of the vertex angle of a regular pentagon. We 
          will use this technique to find the measure of the vertex angles for other   
          regular n-gons.

        more than three polygons meet at a vertex, consider the different ways in 
        which they could be arranged.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          Note that <m>3.4.3.4.3</m> and <m>4.3.4.3.3</m> are potentially two other ways 
          of writing <m>3.3.4.3.4</m> in <xref ref="tiling33434"/>. 
          We could begin at any polygon and list the polygons in order. To avoid these  
          repetitions, it is standard practice to begin with the polygon with the  
          smallest number of sides and then to move to its neighbor with the smallest number 
          of sides, continuing around until all the polygons around the point have been named. 
          Similarly, we write <m>3.3.3.4.4</m> rather than <m>3.3.4.4.3</m> for the tiling where  
          the two squares are adjacent.

    <hint>
      We are not including the three regular tilings in this list. 
      There is one more vertex arrangement using five polygons 
      (in addition to 3.3.4.3.4 and 3.3.3.4.4), five using
      four polygons, and eight more using three polygons (in addition to 3.7.42).

    <statement>
      <p>
        Some of the vertex arrangements in the previous task will extend to create a semiregular titling, 
        but not all of them! Experiment by surrounding one vertex using the pattern and 
        then try to surround the neighboring vertices using the same arrangement. Which 
        seem to work and which fail? For the ones that fail, what seems to go wrong? 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Only eight of the seventeen possible vertex arrangements can be used to create  
        a semiregular tiling.
      </p>
    </hint>
  </task>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        What do you notice about the vertex arrangements that work (or those that don't 
        work)? What do you wonder?
      </p>

<p>
  This activity may have involved more of a struggle that some of the others. Perhaps you 
  only found about half of the possibilities in <xref ref="srtiling-possible-vertex-arrangements"/>
  or you cannot yet see a pattern to help determine which vertex arrangements lead to a 
  semiregular tiling. That is perfectly normal. Write down the ideas that you do have and 
  share them with classmates. As you share what you have observed and listen to others' 
  discoveries, you and your classmates may uncover some amazing results.
