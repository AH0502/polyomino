    <title>Explorations with Regular Polygons</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        Have you ever studied a tiling of a floor or a pattern on a quilt? In this  
        section, we will define a regular polygon and explore when regular tilings 
        can be used to tile the plane. Option to also explore nonregular tilings.

      We begin by defining what it means for a polygon to be regular.

      A polygon is a <term>regular polygon</term> if all of its sides and 
      all of its angles are congruent. <!--Have we defined congruent angles?-->

    In the very first activity, we created a tiling of a square using tetrominos. 
    In this section, we will consider tilings of the plane. Since the plane continues  
    infinitely, we will not be able to fully create a tiling, but we will be able to 
    build enough of the tiling to determine whether a tiling is possible.

        A <term>tiling</term> is a collection of closed polygons that cover a plane 
        (continuing infinitely in all directions) with no 
        gaps and no overlaps. A <term>monohedral tiling</term> is tiling that 
        uses only one shape, 
        a <term>regular tiling</term> is a monohedral tiling using a single 
        regular polygon as its tile.

        This activity may be completed using physical tiles or 
        in an app. Be sure to save a record of your designs by 
        tracing, photography, or screenshots.

          Select a single regular polygon and use it to construct a regular  
          tiling. Construct enough of the tiling to convince others that the 
          tiling can continue to tile the plane with no gaps and overlaps.

          Experiment with equilateral triangles, squares, regular pentagons, 
          regular hexagons, and other regular n-gons to determine which can 
          be used to create a regular tiling and which do not. What do you think 
          will happen with regular polygons with more than ten sides? Why?

          Perhaps you noticed that the vertex angle measure places a role in determining 
          whether a regular polygon can be used to create a regular tiling. This task will  
          lead you to determine the measure of the vertex angle of a regular pentagon. We 
          will use this technique to find the measure of the vertex angles for other   
          regular n-gons.
