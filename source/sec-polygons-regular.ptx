    <title>Explorations with Regular Polygons</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        Have you ever studied a tiling of a floor or a pattern on a quilt? In this  
        section, we will define a regular polygon and explore when regular tilings 
        can be used to tile the plane. Option to also explore nonregular tilings.

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We begin by defining what it means for a polygon to be regular.

    <p>
      A polygon is a <term>regular polygon</term> if all of its sides and 
      all of its angles are congruent. <!--Have we defined congruent angles?-->

          Rhombus ABCD with obtuse angles at B and D,

          4, and total height 6.

    In the very first activity, we created a tiling of a square using tetrominos. 
    In this section, we will consider tilings of the plane. Since the plane continues  
    infinitely, we will not be able to fully create a tiling, but we will be able to 
    build enough of the tiling to determine whether a tiling is possible.

    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>tiling</term> is a collection of closed polygons that cover a plane 
        (continuing infinitely in all directions) with no 
        gaps and no overlaps. A <term>monohedral tiling</term> is tiling that 
        uses only one shape, 
        a <term>regular tiling</term> is a monohedral tiling using a single 
        regular polygon as its tile.

    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>semiregular tiling</term> is a tiling consisting of two or 
        more regular polygon with common side lengths with the additional 
        requirement that the arrangement of polygons around each vertex is 
        the same.
