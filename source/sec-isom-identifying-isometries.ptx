    <title>Summarizing What We Know and Generating New Questions</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
                As we prepare to build on our knowledge of isometries, 
                it is wise to summarize what we know so far. 
                We know that a transformation of a plane is a mapping or function 
                that sends each point <m>P</m> on the
                plane to a unique point <m>P'</m> called its image under the 
                transformation. Some transformations are 
                <term>collineations</term>, meaning that if a set of 
                points all lie on the same line, then their images will also lie on 
                a single line. 
                We have observed that some collineations preserve shape and angle 
                measure and that some collineations 
                that preserve angle measure will also preserve distance. 
                The transformations that preserve all of these, 
                collinearity, angle measure, and distance, are called <term>isometries</term>.

              <p>
                Write down three things you know about transformations,
                especially the three isometries we have looked at, namely 
                reflections, translations, and rotations.

            <li>
              <p>
                Is there anything that was discussed in the first sections 
                on transformations that you need clarity on?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                What do you wonder about transformations? What questions remain?
              </p>
            </li>

    <p>
        We are now familiar with three types of isometries: reflections, 
        translations, and rotations. Are there other types of isometries? 
        Are there transformations that are not isometries? Given a picture 
        of two congruent figures, is there always an isometry mapping one to the other? If so, how do we 
        determine what type of isometry it is? 
    </p>
    <p>
        The answer to the final question is yes. If we have two congruent figures,
        there will be an isometry that maps one onto the other. In fact, this notion 
        of congruence as being able to lay one figure on top of the other preceded
        the more technical measurement definitions for congruence taught in many 
        middle and high school geometry classes. There has been a shift back to 
        this transformational meaning of congruent in recent years. It is possible your 
        teacher adopted this approach.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our goal is this section and next will be to identify the type of isometry 
        that takes one figure onto a congruent copy. Is it a reflection, a translation, 
        a rotation, or something else? Then having determined the type can we specify 
        the exact action that performs the movement. A good place to start is to 
        identify whether the isometry preserves orientation.

                  Imagine that <m>\Delta ABC</m> is a moveable cutout triangle with a pretty blue pattern on 
                  the front face and gray cardboard on the back. We can think of the action of an isometry 
                  as moving <m>\Delta ABC</m> so that it aligns perfectly with its image <m>\Delta A'B'C'</m>.   
                  Which isometries studied so far will keep <m>\Delta ABC</m> blue side up? Which will turn 
                  <m>\Delta ABC</m> over so that it is cardboard side up? What property is this related to?

                How might you tell the difference between a translation and a rotation? Assume that you are 
                given a picture of two congruent triangles <m>\Delta ABC</m> and <m>\Delta A'B'C'</m> where the
                orientation is the same. How do you know whether a translation takes <m>\Delta ABC</m> to 
                <m>\Delta A'B'C'</m>? How do you know whether the isometry is a rotation? Could it be both? or 
                neither?

        <title>Defining Objects of Isometries</title>
            <p>
                Now that we can determine whether the isometry mapping one 
                figure onto a congruent image is a reflection, translation,
                or rotation, we need to identify the defining object(s) of the 
                isometry. Table <xref ref="table-def-obj-1"/> lists the defining 
                objects for the three isometries we have studied. 
            </p>
                <table>
                    <title>Defining Objects for Three Isometries</title>
                    <tabular halign="center">
                        <row header="yes" bottom="minor">

                        </row>
                        <row>
                            <cell>Translation</cell>

                            <cell>Center and Rotational Angle</cell>
                        </row>
                    </tabular>
                </table>
                <p>
                    Although the defining objects will determine how the 
                    isometry acts on all points in the plane, we will focus on just a
                    few points <m>P</m> their images <m>P'</m> in order to find the defining 
                    objects.
