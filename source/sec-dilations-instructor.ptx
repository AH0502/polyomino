      Once again, I introduce new transformations initially with a tactile
      approach on graph paper before moving to the online setting. Although 
      a GeoGebra applet is provided for <xref ref="explor-magnify-quad"/> for instructors not 
      wanting to print out worksheets, I think the time spent working tactilely 
      in groups is worthwhile.

    <xref ref="explore-scalefactor-proportion"/> can be done virtually or on 
      paper copies. The grid allows students to make computations that are more 
      precise than a ruler. Besides being a review, the first task emphasizes that 
      the scale factor is equal to the constant of proportionality and that
      <m>\frac{AA'}{OA'}</m> is a different value. In fact, in this example,
        <md>
          <mrow> \frac{AA'}{OA'}\amp =\frac{OA'-OA}{OA'} </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp =\frac{OA'}{OA'}-\frac{OA}{OA'}</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp =1-\frac{1}{k}</mrow>
        </md>
      where <m>k</m> is the scale factor.

    The applet for <xref ref="explor-golden-triangle"/> is available as a full-size activity 
    on GeoGebra <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/classic/qpfcdb5b"></url>.
    You may copy this lesson, change settings, and assign to your students as
    desired. Note that students will be working with the 
    irrational number <m>\phi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}</m> and 
    <m>\phi-1=\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}</m>. They should be prepared to use a calculator
    or app that allows them to calculate more than a few digits of irrational 
    numbers; the more the better! I usually refer them to Desmos Scientific
    Calculator, <url href="https://www.desmos.com/scientific"></url>, a free 
    web application. Unfortunately, there will always be some
    error due to the rounding of the lengths in GeoGebra. I have set rounding
    in the applet to 5 digits to reduce the number of digits students would 
    have to type into their calculators. If you would like to increase the 
    precision in GeoGebra, use the triple line icon in the upper left to go to settings 
    and then click on the gear icon.
