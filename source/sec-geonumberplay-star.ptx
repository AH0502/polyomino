  <introduction>
    <p>
    In <xref ref="ch-polygons"/>, we explored properties of <xref ref="def-convexconcave">convex</xref> 
    polygons. In this section, we will create regular <xref ref="def-convexconcave">concave</xref> 
    polygons, called star polygons. In addition to studying the geometrical properties of star 
    polygons, we will observe how the relationship between a pair of numbers determines the 
    shape of the star polygon associated with the number pair.
