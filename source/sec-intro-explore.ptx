      <title>Tiling Rectangles with Polyominoes</title>
      
      <introduction>

        <p>
          Although this task is to fill a box, you are encouraged to think 
          outside the box as you do this activity. You will find that a 
          willingness to take chances and try out different strategies will  
          be essential to your success in this course. Taking time to reflect 
          as you respond to the "why" questions and sharing your ideas with 
          your classmates will also contribute 
          greatly to your learning. Have fun!

      <title>Instructor's Note:</title>
      <p>
        This activity should not require much of an introduction and 
        provides an opportunity for students to get to know a few classmates  
        and experience a tactile or visual learning experience 
        in a low-stress environment. Expectations of group work can begin 
        to be established. In my classes, I begin without using technology 
        to encourage interaction. <!--A HANDOUT IS AVAILABLE AT MY INSTRUCTOR's
        PAGE.-->

        As part of the post-exploration discussion, you may want 
        to remind the students about how area is simply the number 
        of unit squares that fill the interior. It can be noted how 
        the area formula for a rectangle is easy to remember and related 
        to the operation for multiplication. In addition, we will be using 
        the fact that the total area is preserved when a figure is cut into 
        smaller figures and then rearranged to form a new figure. This principle 
        will be used to derive area formulas for other figures and to demonstrate 
        the universality of the Pythagorean Theorem.

      This exploration is also available as a Desmos classroom activity.

      For a tactile experience, a classroom set of pentominoes may be provided 
      after students have had enough opportunity to discover most of them on their 
      own in small groups. Printable pentominoes can be found online. 
      Graph paper is useful for discovering pentominoes when technology is not used.

            Just as a domino consists of two squares joined at an edge, a 
            <term>tetromino</term> is a flat figure created by joining four congruent 
            squares along edges. Pictured below are the four other tetrominoes, an I-shape, a Z-shape, a T-shape,
            and a small square. Like the L-shape, some of these can cover the 
            larger square without overlaps or gaps. Identify which tetrominoes 
            will tile one of the larger squares and show how this can be done. If there 
            are any tetrominoes which cannot tile the square alone, explain 
            why you believe the tiling is impossible.

              Four shapes each formed by joining four unit squares along edges: 
              one tall rectangle, one T-shape, one zigzag-shape, and a small 
              square. The frames to fill are squares of the same height as the 
              tall rectangle are also provided.

            Since a tetromino is formed by joining four unit squares, each 
            tetromino has an area of four square units, as illustrated here.

           Similarly, we define a <term>pentomino</term> to be a figure 
           formed by joining five congruent squares along edges. One pentomino 
           is pictured. Create new pentominoes by copying and moving the provided square.   
           Note that if two pentominos are reflections or 
           rotations of each other we consider them to be the same pentomino.

          The purpose of <xref ref="intro-explore-exp-pentrect"/> is two-fold. It introduces the exploratory 
          nature of the course and it suggests a few important geometric facts that 
          we will use as our initial geometrical foundation.

          Hopefully as you worked through this task, you allowed yourself 
          to experiment with different arrangements of squares and 
          polyominoes. This openness to exploration is essential to 
          mathematical thinking. Phrases like "what if" or "I wonder"  
          arise often as mathematicians create and make sense 
          of new ideas. 
        </p>

        <p> In addition, mathematics is a social activity. When we notice 
          patterns and make conjectures, we share our ideas with others and 
          use logic to make convincing arguments. For over 2500 years, mathematicians 
          have been adding to the body of mathematical knowledge; some of which has 
          been shared with you during your studies. The field of mathematics continues 
          to grow. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, most students have had little opportunity to 
          creatively explore in their mathematics classes. You have probably 
          memorized formulas and performed calculations in many of your mathematics 
          classes. While formulas and calculations are useful tools
          in mathematics, they are not the essence of mathematics and 
          can often be done via a computer. In this course, 
          we will develop the creative 
          thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving practices that set humans apart  
          computers and are valued by employers. We will think outside the box, 
          make predictions, and wonder why. Different approaches and strategies are encouraged. 
          Relax and have fun exploring mathematics!
