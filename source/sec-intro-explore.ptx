      <title>To The Student</title>
   
    <p>
      This class may be different from many of the mathematics classes you have 
      taken in the past.  You will be encouraged to explore geometrical ideas, 
      solve puzzles, make conjectures, discuss with classmates, make connections 
      between ideas, explain your solutions, and justify your reasoning.  You 
      should not expect to be shown how to do problems by the instructions. In 
      fact, there may not be one, single right way to complete some of the 
      problems but rather many acceptable ways of coming to a solution.  Your 
      teacher will encourage you to share these alternative approaches with the 
      class. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this course would be easier for you if you were simply told 
      how to solve the problems, but the objective of this course is not 
      to learn facts and methods, but rather to develop your mathematical 
      thinking and communication skills.  In this technological age, 
      computers can do many of the algorithms and processes that used to 
      be the core of mathematics education, but they have not replaced man’s 
      role of developing strategies to solve problems and recognizing when 
      mathematics can be applied to real world situations.  Developing these 
      reasoning skills will help you more in your future than simply being able 
      to quote the Pythagorean Theorem. On the other hand, it is still useful to 
      know the Pythagorean Theorem so that you are able to recognize when it can 
      (and cannot) be used to solve both elementary and complex problems.  This 
      theorem along with some other basic formulas you have learned in the past 
      (and can look up online) form a toolbox for our work, but we will give more 
      emphasis to the creative process that is mathematics.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In <q>A Mathematician’s Lament</q> Paul Lockhart describes a nightmare 
      in which music was taught in the same way that mathematics is currently 
      taught.<!--~\cite{lament}-->  He says, 
    </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Mathematics is the music of reason. To do mathematics is to engage in an act of discovery and conjecture, 
          intuition and inspiration; to be in a state of confusion— not because it 
          makes no sense to you, but because you gave it sense and you still don’t 
          understand what your creation is up to; to have a breakthrough idea; to 
          be frustrated as an artist; to be awed and overwhelmed by an almost painful 
          beauty; to be alive.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          If we were to teach music via lecture and mere recall, 
          focusing on the notation and structure, but not allowing students to experience 
          and create music, the subject would be dry and uninteresting, the creative 
          process would be stifled, and very few would have an interest in learning 
          music.  Yet, that is what we have done with much of our mathematics instruction.  
          We have removed both the exploration and the fun. 
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    <p>
      So I encourage you to embrace the experience that is mathematics.  
      Approach each puzzle with an open mind, make guesses as to what is 
      happening, and experiment to determine whether your ideas are correct.  
      Play with the materials and the concepts and ask new questions.  In this 
      course, you might even be invited to explore a question you posed instead 
      of the one the teacher originally posed!  Mathematics is not just about finding the answer; 
      even when there is an answer, our work should evoke new questions: Why? What else?

          Although this task is to fill a box, you are encouraged to think 
          outside the box as you do this activity. You will find that a 
          willingness to take chances and try out different strategies will  
          be essential to your success in this course. Taking time to reflect 
          as you respond to the "why" questions and sharing your ideas with 
          your classmates will also contribute 
          greatly to your learning. Have fun!

            Just as a domino consists of two squares joined at an edge, a 
            <term>tetromino</term> is a flat figure created by joining four congruent 
            squares along edges. Pictured below are the four other tetrominoes, 
            an I-shape, a Z-shape, a T-shape,
            and a small square. Like the L-shape, some of these can cover the 
            larger square without overlaps or gaps. Identify which tetrominoes 
            will tile one of the larger squares and show how this can be done. If there 
            are any tetrominoes which cannot tile the square alone, explain 
            why you believe the tiling is impossible.

            Once again in the application, 
            copies of the I-shape, Z-shape, T-shape, and small square 
            can be created by clicking the shape and dragging. Four larger squares are 
            provided; try to tile one with the I-shape, one with the Z-shape, etc.

          The purpose of <xref ref="intro-explore-exp-pentrect"/> is two-fold. It introduces the exploratory 
          nature of the course and it also suggests a few important geometric facts that 
          we will use as our initial geometrical foundation. These facts are chosen because  
          they are intuitively obvious, but they give us some building blocks we will need to 
          justify more complex ideas. We state them here for clarity and future reference.

          Hopefully as you worked through this task, you allowed yourself 
          to experiment with different arrangements of squares and 
          polyominoes. This openness to exploration is essential to 
          mathematical thinking. Phrases like "what if" or "I wonder"  
          arise often as mathematicians create and make sense 
          of new ideas. 
        </p>

        <p> In addition, mathematics is a social activity. When we notice 
          patterns and make conjectures, we share our ideas with others and 
          use logic to make convincing arguments. For over 2500 years, mathematicians 
          have been adding to the body of mathematical knowledge; some of which has 
          been shared with you during your studies. The field of mathematics continues 
          to grow. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, most students have had little opportunity to 
          creatively explore in their mathematics classes. You have probably 
          memorized formulas and performed calculations in many of your mathematics 
          classes. While formulas and calculations are useful tools
          in mathematics, they are not the essence of mathematics and 
          can often be done via a computer. In this course, 
          we will develop the creative 
          thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving practices that set humans apart  
          computers and are valued by employers. We will think outside the box, 
          make predictions, and wonder why. Different approaches and strategies are encouraged. 
          Relax and have fun exploring mathematics!
