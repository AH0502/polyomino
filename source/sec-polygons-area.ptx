        <title>Discovering Area Formulas</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                In this activity we will determine the area formulas for three 
                shapes, a parallelogram, a triangle, and a trapezoid. Our goal 
                will be not only to use the formulas but more importantly to be  
                able to explain why they follow from the basic principles.
