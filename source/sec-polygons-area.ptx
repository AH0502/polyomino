    <title>Exploring Area</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this section, we will determine the area formulas for three 
            shapes: a parallelogram, a triangle, and a trapezoid. Our goal 
            will be not only to use the formulas but more importantly to be  
            able to explain why they follow from the basic principles of area. In 
            particular, we will use the formula for the area of a rectangle,
            <m>A=\ell\times w</m>, as a starting point to derive additional 
            area formulas.

        <title>Discovering the Area Formula for a Triangle</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                You probably remember the area formula for a triangle; in fact, you 
                may have used it already in this course! But why is the area

                        dimensions, but we want a formula that will work for all triangles, 
                        not just the one you have. Variables allow us to generalize formulas.

                    Challenge yourself (or your group) to find a method that is  
                    different than the methods used by others in your class. Instructions

                    How does your (de)construction demonstrate that the area formula for 
                    a trapezoid is <m>A_{trap}=\frac{1}{2}(b_1+b_2)h</m>? The steps that 
                    follow will assist you in forming a convincing argument. You may have
                    already completed some of this work in the above task.

                            Choose one of the constructions or deconstructions you created 
                            in the previous task. Label the height of the trapezoid with the 
                            variable <m>h</m>. The summit and base of the trapezoid are typically 
                            labeled <m>b_1</m> and <m>b_2</m>, and these are the labels that I will
                            use in these instructions, but you are free to assign them other labels
                            if you would like to avoid subscripts. Once you select 
                            your labels for the height, base, and summit, you should use them 
                            consistently for the remainder of this activity. In fact, these labels will 
                            only be used for lengths known to be equal to the height, base, and summit
                            of the original trapezoid.

                                Others may use <m>b</m> and <m>b'</m>. You could even name 
                                the summit <m>s</m> or <m>Elizabeth</m> if you 
                                desire. On the other hand, <m>Elizabeth</m> is a 
                                bit long to use in diagrams 
                                and formulas so single letters are usually chosen.

                            new length or height should be given a different label. If you find that you need to create a lot 
                            of new labels, you might want to use a different construction or deconstruction
                            to reduce the amount of algebra you will need to do later.

                            labeled <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>, you would write down the relationship

            Thoughts on Area
        </title>
        <p>
            Adding the formula <m>A=\frac{1}{2}(b_1+b_2)h</m> for the area of a 
            trapezoid, we now have four area formulas in our toolbox. We could 
            continue to derive the area of more shapes like kites, pentagons, 
            hexagons, etc., but the list would become unwieldy and unhelpful. 
            <idx><h>trapezoid</h><h>area</h></idx>
            <idx><h>area</h><h>of a trapezoid</h></idx>
            Instead, we will  
            simply break other polygons into triangles, parallelograms, 
            and other shapes so that we can compute their area. We can then add 
            (or subtract) the areas as appropriate. Measuring tools could 
            be used to estimate the dimensions needed to compute the area 
            of physical space such as floorspace or a garden.

                        and passes through the center is called a <term>diameter</term>. The 
                        length of a diameter is also called the <term>diameter</term> and is twice 
                        the length of the radius.

                Archimedes (287-212 BC) determined the area of a circle by looking at inscribed and 
                circumscribed<fn>See <xref ref="fig-circle-squares"/> for an illustration of these terms.</fn> 
                polygons. As the number of sides grew, the area of the polygons would 
                approach the area of the circle, with the area of the inscribed polygons giving a lower 
                estimate and the area of the circumscribed polygons giving an overestimate. The number  
                <m>\pi</m> was not known at the time, but this method provides a means of calculating 
                <m>\pi</m> to any level of precision. Note that <m>\pi\neq 3.14</m>. The value <m>3.14</m>
                is only a rough estimate. In fact, mathematicians have now calculated over sixty 
                trillion digits for <m>\pi</m>.  For our purposes, <m>\pi\approx 3.14159...</m> should 
                be sufficient, but space travel engineers usually need about 40 digits of <m>\pi</m> for their 
                work.

                There are two measurements associated with a circle. In addition to area 
                which measures the interior space, we often wish to compute the length of 
                the boundary around the circle. We call this boundary length the <term>circumference</term>
                of the circle and can think of it as the length of string needed to wrap around 
                the circle. Both area and circumference depend only on the length of the 
                circle's <term>radius</term>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A technique, similar to the one described for estimating area using 
                polygons of increasing number of sides, can be used to find the circumference 
                or distance around a circle. We give the resulting formula below.

                        For area, the region may be broken up into triangles and rectangles in 
                        various ways. The rare student may use parallelograms or trapezoids in 
                        their dissection. Some students will likely just count full squares and 
                        half squares in each row. With the latter strategy, note that the lower 
                        left segment does not divide squares exactly in half.

                    <p>
                        The rectangle RSTU will have the larger area because the height of 
                        parallelogram WXYZ will be less than the length of its side.

                    <p>
                        A rectangle is a special type of parallelogram where all angles are 90 degrees. For a parallelogram and
                        a rectangle with the same side lengths (3 and 4 inches), the rectangle will always have the larger area. 
                        This is because the rectangle's height is equal to its side length (e.g., 3 or 4 inches), while a 
                        non-rectangular parallelogram's height will be shorter than its slanted side, reducing its area. 
                        A picture would clearly show the parallelogram "leaning" and thus being shorter in vertical height 
                        compared to the rectangle.

                            square fitted inside it, that inner square's area is smaller. Therefore, the circle's area is greater than 
                            the inner square's area but less than the outer square's area.

                        <p>
                            When a circle is inscribed within a square, the circle touches the middle of each of the square's sides.
                            This means the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. With a radius of 5, the circle's 
                            diameter is 10, making the sides of the square also 10. Therefore, the area of HIJK is <m>10\cdot 10 = 100</m>

                            What do you expect to be true about the areas of 
                            the square, the octagon, and the circle? Why?

                            Consider how much of the circle's area each shape occupies. More sides allow a polygon to fill the space more completely.

                    <solution>
                        <p>
                            When a square and an octagon are both placed inside the same circle, with their corners touching the circle's 
                            edge, the square covers less area than the octagon. This is because the octagon's eight sides allow it to fill the 
                            circular space more fully compared to the square's four sides. Therefore, area(square) &lt; area(octagon) &lt; area(circle).

                    <solution>
                        <p>
                            The diagonal of the square is the same as the circle's diameter. Since the radius is 4, the
                            diameter is 8. The area of the square is half of its diagonal squared. So,
                            <m>(8\cdot 8) / 2</m>. Therefore, the area of the square is 32.

                            An octagon inside a circle with a radius of 4 forms 8 triangles. Each triangle has two sides of
                            length 4, meeting at a 45 degree angle. Using the triangle area formula, each is
                            <m>4\sqrt{2}</m>. Multiply by 8 for the total: <m>32\sqrt{2}\approx 45.25</m>.

                            The radius of the circle is 4. Recall that the area of a circle is <m>A = \pi r^2</m>. Multiply
                            <m>\pi</m> by <m>4^2</m> (which is 16). So, the area is <m>16\pi</m> or approximately 50.2.
