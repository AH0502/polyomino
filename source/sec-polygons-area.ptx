    <title>Why do the area formulas hold?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In these activities we will determine the area formulas for three 
            shapes, a parallelogram, a triangle, and a trapezoid. Our goal 
            will be not only to use the formulas but more importantly to be  
            able to explain why they follow from the basic principles. In 
            particular, we will use the formula for the area of a rectangle,
            <m>A=\ell\times w</m>, as our starting point and derive other 
            area formulas from it.

                                A parallelogram with two different angle
                                measures and two different lengths.

                                and four congruent sides.

                    Beginning with the parallelogram pictured below or the one you 
                            sketched in <xref ref="sketchaparallelogram"/>, explain and demonstrate 
                            how you would construct a rectangle with the same area. You are allowed 
                            to cut the parallelogram and rearrange or duplicate pieces as part of your 
                            argument.

                Building on the previous problem, derive an area formula for a parallelogram.
                Explain how it comes from the area formula for a rectangle and how you know it 
                must work for all parallelograms.
