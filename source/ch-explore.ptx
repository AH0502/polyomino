        <p>
          Although this task is to fix a box, you are encouraged to think 
          outside the box as you do this activity. You will find that a 
          willingness to take chances and try out different strategies will  
          be essential to your success in this course. Taking time to reflect 
          as you respond to the "why" questions and sharing your ideas with 
          your classmates will also contribute 
          greatly to your learning. Have fun!

            Fill the blue square with non-overlapping copies of the green L-shaped 
            tetronimo. How many tetrominos are required?

            Just as a domino consists of two squares joined at an edge, a 
            <term>tetromino</term> is a flat figure created by joining four congruent 
            squares along edges. Pictured below are the four other tetrominoes, an I-shape, a Z-shape, a T-shape,
            and a small square. Like the L-shape, some of these can cover the 
            larger square without overlaps or gaps. Identify which tetrominoes 
            will tile one of the larger squares and show how this can be done. If there 
            are any tetrominoes which cannot tile the square alone, explain 
            why you believe the tiling is impossible.

              Four shapes each formed by joining four unit squares along edges: 
              one tall rectangle, one T-shape, one zigzag-shape, and a small 
              square. The frames to fill are squares of the same height as the 
              tall rectangle are also provided.

            Since a tetromino is formed by joining four unit squares, each 
            tetromino has an area of four square units, as illustrated here.

           Similarly, we define a <term>pentomino</term> to be a figure 
           formed by joining five congruent squares along edges. One pentomino 
           is pictured. Use copies of the small square to construct other pentominoes. 
           There are twelve total! Note that if two pentominos are reflections or 
           rotations of the other we consider them to be the same pentomino.

              Five squares joined at edges with three in the first column and one  
              at the top and one at the bottom of  
              the second column. An additional square is provided to build 
              more pentominoes.

            Use some of the different pentominoes you created to 
            build solid rectangles. Use each pentomino at most once 
            in each rectangle you build. What 
            dimensions are possible? Can you build a rectangle that 
            uses every pentomino exactly once?
