            Cover the blue square with copies of the green L-shaped 
            tetronimo. Do not overlap any tetrominoes or leave any 
            gaps. How many tetrominos are required?

            Pictured below are the four other tetrominoes, an I-shape, a Z-shape, a T-shape,
            and a small square. Like the L-shape, some of these can cover the 
            larger square without overlaps or gaps. Identify which tetrominoes 
            will tile the large square and show how this can be done. If there 
            are any tetrominoes which cannot tile the square alone, explain 
            why you believe the tiling is impossible.
