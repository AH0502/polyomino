      <introduction>

        <p>
          Although this task is to fix a box, you are encouraged to think 
          outside the box as you do this activity. You will find that a 
          willingness to take chances and try out different strategies will  
          be essential to your success in this course. Taking time to reflect 
          as you respond to the "why" questions and sharing your ideas with 
          your classmates will also contribute 
          greatly to your learning. Have fun!

            Fill the blue square with non-overlapping copies of the green L-shaped 
            tetronimo. How many tetrominos are required?

              An L-shape and square.The L is three-fourths as high 
              and half as wide as the square.

            Just as a domino consists of two squares joined at an edge, a 
            <term>tetromino</term> is a flat figure created by joining four congruent 
            squares along edges. Pictured below are the four other tetrominoes, an I-shape, a Z-shape, a T-shape,
            and a small square. Like the L-shape, some of these can cover the 
            larger square without overlaps or gaps. Identify which tetrominoes 
            will tile the large square and show how this can be done. If there 
            are any tetrominoes which cannot tile the square alone, explain 
            why you believe the tiling is impossible.

              Four shapes each formed by joining four unit squares along edges: 
              one tall rectangle, one T-shape, one zigzag-shape, and a small 
              square. The frames to fill are squares of the same height as the 
              tall rectangle are also provided.

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Since a tetromino is formed by joining four unit squares, each 
            tetromino has an area of four square units.
