  <title>An Introduction to Reflections</title>
<introduction>
<p>
    A <term>reflection</term> is the first transformation we will explore. 
    Each reflection is defined by a 
    mirror line and the reflection takes each point to its reflected image. If we were to fold the plane across
    the mirror line, the points and their images would fall on top of each other.
    The exploration <xref ref="expl-reflect-pentomino-coordplane"/> is best 
    done by hand so that you get a deeper understanding 
    of what happens to points in a transformation. Print out the pictures and use colored 
    pencils or use virtual copies of the pictures if you are able to draw on images.

<p component="instructor">
    A pdf version of this activity is available. Be sure to check that students correctly 
    sketch the reflection in <xref ref="drawreflection"/>. Encourage students to compare 
    their sketches with others and discuss if there are different sketches. Miras (math education supply stores) or  small 
    mirrors (craft stores) can be effective at resolving differences and helping students visualize,
    but I recommend letting them try to draw the reflection first without these aids.

                On graph paper, line GH passes through the points G(0,0) and H(4,4).
                A backwards P-pentomino is formed using the following sequence of points:
                A(0,6), B(2,6), C(2,3), D(1,3), E(1,4), and F(0,4). Axes are not shown.

            If you are using paper, you can check your answer by folding 
            across line <m>\overleftrightarrow{GH}</m>.
            Do your figures line up?

                            reflecting it across any line in the plane.  What do you expect to be true about the relationship between the segment

                                The letter <m>P</m> is being used as a variable point that can represent 
                                any point on the plane, including <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and so forth. 
                                When <m>P=A</m>, <m>P'=A'</m>.
                                When <m>P=C</m>, <m>P'=C'</m>. This allows us to discuss properties that 
                                hold for all points in a single statement.
