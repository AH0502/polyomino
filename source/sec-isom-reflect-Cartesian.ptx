  <title>An Introduction to Reflections</title>
<introduction>
<p>
    A <term>reflection</term> is the first transformation we will explore. 
    Each reflection is defined by a 
    mirror line and the reflection takes each point to its reflected image. If we were to fold the plane across
    the mirror line, the points and their images would fall on top of each other.
</p>
<p>
    As you begin this section, it can be advantageous to use paper and colored pencils, 
    printing out 
    <!--<xref ref="fig-reflectP"/>, <xref ref="fig-findline"/>, and
    <xref ref="fig-refl-across-both-axes"/>--> 
    <xref ref="fig-reflect-paperP"/> or carefully copying it onto 
    graph paper. Tactile tools will encourage us to use previous experience 
    and develop spacial skills, giving us a broader understanding of reflections
    and the Cartesian coordinate system. 
    In addition, working on paper allows us to check our work by folding.
</p>
<p>
    We will use GeoGebra tools for finding reflections in 
    <xref ref="sec-composing-reflections"/>. Although a GeoGebra interactive 
    is available for both <xref ref="draw-reflection"/> in the current 
    section are designed to mimic tasks you would do with paper and pencils
    and do not exploit the power of GeoGebra. In fact, in the interactive 
    version reflection tools have been turned off.

        Key Ideas regarding Reflections
    </title>
    <p>
        In this section, we have drawn reflections by hand using a coordinate grid 
        as an aid and we observed a few of the properties of reflections. Since we will be  
        building on these discoveries, it is wise to summarize the main ideas for future 
        reference.

                A <term>reflection across a line <m>\ell</m></term> is a transformation of the points in the 
                plane which maps each point <m>P</m> in the plane by flipping it over
                line <m>\ell</m>. The reflecting line <m>\ell</m> is called the <term>mirror</term>
                or <term>axis</term>. The <term>image</term> of a point <m>P</m> under a 
                reflection (or any other transformation) is the point <m>P'</m> that the 
                transformation sends <m>P</m> to; in this case, the reflection of point <m>P</m>.  
            </p>

    <p>
        While the notion of reflecting can be intuitively understood as flipping, the 
        properties you discovered in <xref ref="disc-prop-reflection-perp-bis"></xref> 
        provide a more specific definition that can be extended to other geometries. These  
        properties are identified in <xref ref="fillin-refl-def-prop"/> and should be 
        added to your toolbox.

    <p>
        So far, we have only reflected across lines that were either horizontal, 
        vertical, or which make a 45-degree angle to the horizontal. As we expand our 
        consideration to reflections across other lines, we will drop the coordinate grid and use  
        technology.
