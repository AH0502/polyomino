  <title>An Introduction to Reflections</title>
<introduction>
<p>
    A <term>reflection</term> is the first transformation we will explore. 
    Each reflection is defined by a 
    mirror line and the reflection takes each point to its reflected image. If we were to fold the plane across
    the mirror line, the points and their images would fall on top of each other.
    The exploration <xref ref="expl-reflect-pentomino-coordplane"/> may be done
    by hand or by using the provided applet.

            If you are using paper, you can check your answer by folding 
            across line <m>\overleftrightarrow{GH}</m>. Otherwise, imagine
            what would happen if you were to fold across this line.
            Do your figures line up?

        Key Ideas regarding Reflections
    </title>
    <p>
        In this section, we have drawn reflections by hand using a coordinate grid 
        as an aid and we observed a few of the properties of reflections. Since we will be  
        building on these discoveries, it is wise to summarize the main ideas for future 
        reference.

                A <term>reflection across a line <m>\ell</m></term> is a transformation of the points in the 
                plane which maps each point <m>P</m> in the plane by flipping it over
                line <m>\ell</m>. The reflecting line <m>\ell</m> is called the <term>mirror</term>
                or <term>axis</term>. The <term>image</term> of a point <m>P</m> under a 
                reflection (or any other transformation) is the point <m>P'</m> that the 
                transformation sends <m>P</m> to; in this case, the reflection of point <m>P</m>.  
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
        While the notion of reflecting can be intuitively understood as flipping, the 
        properties you discovered in <xref ref="disc-prop-reflection-perp-bis"></xref> 
        provide a more specific definition that can be extended to other geometries. These  
        properties are identified in <xref ref="fillin-refl-def-prop"/> and should be 
        added to your toolbox.

    <p>
        So far, we have only reflected across lines that were either horizontal, 
        vertical, or which make a 45-degree angle to the horizontal. As we expand our 
        consideration to reflections across other lines, we will drop the coordinate grid and use  
        technology.
