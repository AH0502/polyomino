  <title>Building a Course Toolbox</title>
<p>
  Throughout our learning, and in fact throughout our lives, we add knowledge to our toolkit
  that we can later reference as needed. The tools in our toolkit can then be used to solve problems, 
  to further build our understanding of related concepts, and to support the validity of an argument.
</p>
<p> 
  Inside the toolbox for this course, we currently have the three principles, <xref ref="intro-explore-principle-areameaning"/>, 
  <xref ref="intro-explore-principle-arearect"/>, and <xref ref="intro-explore-principle-areasums"/> from 
  <xref ref="intro-sec-explore"/>. In other words, we can use the area formula for a rectangle and 
  the fact that the area of a region is equal to the sum of the area of its parts. 
  We will also include in our toolbox all of the algebraic rules 
  and procedures that allow us to perform calculations, simplify expressions, and solve 
  equations. Eventually we will add more tools to our collection including the Pythagorean theorem, 
  area formulas for other shapes, and other geometrical theorems and formulas. 
</p>
<p>
  Definitions are also important 
  in mathematics as they often include key properties. As we encounter new definitions, these too 
  will be added to our tool box. In the first part of this course, we will work 
  primarily with polygons. What is a polygon? Giving a clear, clean definition of the word
  "polygon" is difficult so we will describe it verbally and give several examples. If you search for 
  the definition, you will probably learn that a polygon is a closed plane figure formed by a sequence 
  of straight 
  sides. Thus a polygon is a shape that lies in the plane or on a flat surface. By closed, we mean 
  that a polygon will have a well-defined interior; the polygon forms a solid boundary between this 
  interior and the rest of the plane.

<title>Explorations with Tangrams</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    In this exploration, use the tools currently in our toolbox as you answer the questions. 
    You may find yourself wanting to use the Pythagorean theorem 
    and the area formula for a triangle, but you are encouraged to try to answer the questions 
    without these formulas. In fact, if you find yourself using the Pythagorean theorem, there is  
    probably an easier method!
  </p>
  <p>
    A set of tangrams consists of the following seven pieces, two large triangles, one medium 
    triangle, a parallelogram, a square, and two small triangles. 
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="Tangrampieces">
    <caption>The Seven Tangrams</caption>
    <image source="tangram_pieces">
      <description>
        Seven tangram shapes. The triangles are all isosceles right triangles and the parallelogram 
        is equilateral. The small triangles can be arranged to fill either the square, 
        the parallelogram, or the medium triangle. The hypotenuse of the medium triangle is the same 
        as the base of the large triangle.

    You are encouraged to move the pieces around: either print and cut the shapes shown above or 
    open the tangram interactive on Polypad by Mathigon.
