<title>Invitation to Apply Knowledge </title>
<introduction>
<p>
  Throughout our learning, and in fact throughout our lives, we add knowledge to our toolkit
  that we can later reference as needed. The tools in our toolkit can then be used to solve problems, 
  to further build our understanding of related concepts, and to support the validity of an argument.
</p>
<p> 
  Our first tools will be the principles, <xref ref="intro-explore-principle-areameaning"/>, 
  <xref ref="intro-explore-principle-arearect"/>, and <xref ref="intro-explore-principle-areasums"/> from 
  <xref ref="intro-sec-explore"/>. In other words, we can use the area formula for a rectangle and 
  the fact that the area of a region is equal to the sum of the area of its parts. 
  We will also include in our toolbox all of the algebraic rules 
  and procedures that allow us to perform calculations, simplify expressions, and solve 
  equations. Eventually we will add more tools to our collection including the Pythagorean theorem and 
  area formulas for other shapes. In the following exploration, you may use the Pythagorean theorem 
  and the area formula for a triangle, but you are encouraged to try to answer the questions with 
  only the tools we already have. In fact, if you find yourself using the Pythagorean theorem, there is  
  probably an easier method!

    A variation of the tangram activity will work here.
