  <title>Building a Course Toolbox</title>
<p>
  Throughout our learning, and in fact throughout our lives, we add knowledge to our toolkit
  that we can later reference as needed. The tools in our toolkit can then be used to solve problems, 
  to further build our understanding of related concepts, and to support the validity of an argument.
  You are already familiar with some of these tools. You've learned how to perform 
  computations, have used some geometric formulas, and can recognize many shapes. 
</p>
<p> 
  Although you may already know some of the facts and formulas from previous coursework, we 
  will develop a toolbox from the ground up, starting with basic principles and assumptions 
  that are intuitively obvious. With many geometric formulas and theorems, we will want to explore 
  why these are true before adding them to our toolbox. Currently our course toolbox only 
  contains the three principles, <xref ref="intro-explore-principle-areameaning"/>, 
  <xref ref="intro-explore-principle-arearect"/>, and <xref ref="intro-explore-principle-areasums"/> from 
  <xref ref="sec-intro-explore"/>. In other words, we can think about the area of a region as 
  the number of <m>1\times1</m> blocks that fills the interior, we can use the area formula 
  for a rectangle, and we know that
  the area of a region is equal to the sum of the area of its parts. 
  We will also include in our toolbox all of the algebraic rules 
  and procedures that allow us to perform calculations, simplify expressions, and solve 
  equations. Eventually we will add more tools to our collection including the Pythagorean theorem, 
  area formulas for other shapes, and other geometrical theorems and formulas, but the
  reasons behind these will be explored in future sections and based on the initial three 
  principles. 
</p>
<p>
  Definitions are important in mathematics as they often include key properties. 
  As we encounter new definitions, these too 
  will be added to our tool box. As you work through the next exploration, you will 
  encounter terms like trapezoid and isosceles. Definitions for these and other terms are 
  provided at the end of this section in case you would like to refresh your memory.

<title>Explorations with Tangrams</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    In this exploration, use the tools currently in our toolbox as you answer the questions. 
    You may find yourself wanting to use the Pythagorean theorem 
    and the area formula for a triangle, but you are encouraged to try to answer the questions 
    without these formulas. In fact, if you find yourself using the Pythagorean theorem, there is  
    probably an easier method!
  </p>
  <p>
    A set of tangrams consists of the following seven pieces, two large triangles, one medium 
    triangle, a parallelogram, a square, and two small triangles. 
  </p>

    <caption>The Seven Tangrams</caption>
    <image source="tangram_pieces">
      <description>
        Seven tangram shapes. The triangles are all isosceles right triangles and the parallelogram 
        is equilateral. The small triangles can be arranged to fill either the square, 
        the parallelogram, or the medium triangle. The hypotenuse of the medium triangle is the same 
        as the base of the large triangle. 
      </description>

    To complete this exploration, you will need to move the seven Tangram pieces 
    around. If you do not have a set of Tangrams, you may print and cut out the 
    shapes shown above. A tangram interactive is also availabe on Polypad by Mathigon

    <title>Defining Polygons</title>
<p>
  In the first part of this course, we will work 
  primarily with polygons. What is a polygon? Giving a clear, clean definition of the word
  "polygon" is difficult so we will describe it verbally and give several examples. If you search for 
  the definition, you will probably learn that a polygon is a closed plane figure formed by a sequence 
  of straight 
  sides. <idx><h>polygon</h></idx> Thus, a polygon is a shape that lies in the plane or on a flat surface. By closed, we mean 
  that a polygon will have a well-defined interior; the polygon forms a solid boundary between this 
  interior and the rest of the plane.

      <title>Isosceles and Equilateral Triangles</title>
      <p>
        Some textbooks will restrict the term isosceles triangle to a triangle with exactly two  
        congruent sides while others allow two or all three of the sides to be congruent. 
        This latter definition is used when one is  
        one wants to argue that properties of isosceles triangles extend to equilateral triangles.

    <!--The next two paragraphs do not appear. Perhaps they will when more is added to this section.-->
    <p>
        Should you become a teacher, it is wise to be mindful of how your textbook uses these terms. In the early 
        sections of this text, we will distinguish between isosceles and equilateral triangles  
        as you are asked to sketch and identify examples. When we explore properties of triangles, 
        you may use the fact that properties of an isosceles triangle will also hold for equilateral  
        triangles. 
      </p> 
      <p>
        In case you are curious, <sq>equilateral</sq> comes from Latin and French words meaning equal 
        sides.
