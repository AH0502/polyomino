            To begin our study of angle measure, we will adopt the practice of 
            assuming that there are 360 degrees in a
            full rotation about any point. The choice of 360 can be traced back 
            to the Babylonians who were studying planetory paths around 400 B.C. 
            and used a base 60 (instead of base 10) number system. One advantage 
            of 360 is that it has a lot of factors, including 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.

            a rotation of 180 degrees will take 
            the ray <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m> to the ray <m>\overrightarrow{AC}</m>

            We can continue to define the measurement of angles according to what 
            fraction of a full (or half) rotation they represent. Notice how the  
            protractor divides the semicircular arc into 180 segments, eighteen of which are labeled 
            with numerical values. These are multiples of ten, representing <m>\frac{1}{18}</m> 
            of the half-rotation. To find the measure of <m>\angle{DAB}</m>, we  
            place the center dot of the protractor over the vertex <m>A</m> of the 
            angle and lined up ray <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m> with the mark for 0 
            degrees. The other side of the angle <m>\overrightarrow{AD}</m> passes  
            through the label for 40 degrees.

    <title>Additivity of Angles and Definitions Associated with Angles</title>

        In this section, you have likely been assuming the additivity of angle

            A <term>line</term> is a one-dimensional figure consisting of a set of  
            points. It does not have any thickness. Because a line extends infinitely 
            in both directions
            and has no endpoints, we cannot measure the length of a line. For any two 
            distinct points, there is exactly one line that contains both of them so 
            we may refer 
            to a line by a pair of points on the line, <m>\overleftrightarrow{AB}</m> 
            or by a single lower case letter such as <m>\ell</m> or <m>m</m>.  
          </p>
          <p>
            When we talk about measuring length, we are referring to a 
            line segment. A <term>line segment</term> is a part of a line consisting 
            of a pair of endpoints and all of the points on the line between the 
            two endpoints. For example, line segment <m>\overline{AB}</m> 
            consists of points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> and all points on line
            <m>\overleftrightarrow{AB}</m> between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a similar way, we define <term>ray</term> <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m>
            to consist of point <m>A</m>, point <m>B</m>, and all points on line 
            <m>\overleftrightarrow{AB}</m> which are on the same side of <m>A</m> as 
            point <m>B</m>. A ray extends infinitely in one direction, has a single 
            endpoint, and cannot be measured.

            An <term>angle</term> is the union of two rays with a common endpoint.
            In particular, <m>\angle ABC</m> consists of all points that lie on the 
            rays <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m> and <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m>. The common 
            endpoint is called the <term>vertex</term> of the angle and the two rays 
            are called the <term>sides</term> of the angle.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we measure an angle, denoted <m>m\angle ABC</m>, 
            we are measuring how far we would need to rotate 
            one side of the angle 
            around the vertex to meet the other side. This definition introduces some  
            ambiguity as one might rotate clockwise or counterclockwise and we could even
            rotate multiple times around the vertex. Typically, we will consider the measure 
            of an angle to be a number between 0 and 180 but there will be some exceptions. 
            When we study symmetry and 
            isometry later in <xref ref="ch-isom"/>, we will allow a wider variety of  
            rotations. In addition, we might speak of the interior of some angles of a 
            concave polygon as having at least one interior angle with a measure 
            between 180 and 360 degrees.

                    Must the right angle be the largest angle of a right triangle?
                    Explain how this follows from results of this section.

                                What does this tell you about the angle sum of a convex quadrilateral?
                                Explain in words and pictures why this will be true for all convex   
                                quadrilaterals.

                                Experiment with other triangles or by moving vertex A in the applet.
                                What happens to the angle measure when the quadrilateral is no longer convex?

                    Different interpretations of angles in a concave quadrilateral 
                    can be made here. In your explanation, 
                    you may need to specific whether you are looking only at interior angles or 
                    only considering angles less than 180 degrees.
