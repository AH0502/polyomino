    <title>Rotational Angles and a Tool for Measurement</title>

            To begin our study of angle measure, we will adopt the practice of 
            assuming that there are 360 degrees in a
            full rotation about any point. The choice of 360 can be traced back 
            to the Babylonians who were studying planetory paths around 400 B.C. 
            and used a base 60 (instead of base 10) number system. One advantage 
            of 360 is that it has a lot of factors, including 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8. 
            This will prove helpful in <xref ref="sec-polygons-regular"/>.

            Suppose point <m>A</m> lies between points <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> on 
            line <m>\overleftrightarrow{BC}</m>. Since <m>\frac{360}{2}=180</m>, 
            a rotation of 180 degrees will take 
            the ray <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m> to the ray <m>\overrightarrow{AC}</m>
            on the opposite side of <m>A</m>.

            We can continue to define the measurement of angles according to what 
            fraction of a full (or half) rotation they represent. Notice how the  
            protractor divides the semicircular arc into 180 segments, eighteen of which are labeled 
            with numerical values. To find the measure of <m>\angle{DAB}</m>, we have  
            placed the center dot of the protractor over the vertex <m>A</m> of the 
            angle and lined up ray <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m> with the mark for 0 
            degrees. The other side of the angle <m>\overrightarrow{AD}</m> passes  
            through the label for 40 degrees.

                It is possible to have angle measures greater than 180 degrees. 
                Use words and/or pictures to describe an angle that measures 240 
                degrees.

    UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!This section may include an exploration that leads to the claim that the total angle 
    measure of a triangle is 180 degrees and possibly also the corresponding angle theorem. 
      Make three congruent triangles such that the shape can be altered simultaneously, but 
      the triangles can be translated and rotated freely. Be sure to note that we observed this  
      without proof. Include a principle for additivity of angles.
