            To begin our study of angle measure, we will adopt the practice of 
            assuming that there are 360 degrees in a
            full rotation about any point. The choice of 360 can be traced back 
            to the Babylonians who were studying planetory paths around 400 B.C. 
            and used a base 60 (instead of base 10) number system. One advantage 
            of 360 is that it has a lot of factors, including 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.

            a rotation of 180 degrees will take 
            the ray <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m> to the ray <m>\overrightarrow{AC}</m>

            We can continue to define the measurement of angles according to what 
            fraction of a full (or half) rotation they represent. Notice how the  
            protractor divides the semicircular arc into 180 segments, eighteen of which are labeled 
            with numerical values. To find the measure of <m>\angle{DAB}</m>, we have  
            placed the center dot of the protractor over the vertex <m>A</m> of the 
            angle and lined up ray <m>\overrightarrow{AB}</m> with the mark for 0 
            degrees. The other side of the angle <m>\overrightarrow{AD}</m> passes  
            through the label for 40 degrees.

    <title>Additivity of Angles and Some Results</title>

        In this section, you have likely been assuming the additivity of angle

        and <xref ref="polygons-principle-addlengths">length</xref>, this is intuitively obvious and 
        will prove useful. We state this as a principle and add it to our toolbox.
