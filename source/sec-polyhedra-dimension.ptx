  <title>Measuring in Different Dimensions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we complete our section on three-dimensional solids, let us take a closer 
      look at the relationships between measurements of one-, two-, and three-dimensional
      objects.
    </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-polyhedra-dimension-interior">
      <title>Measuring Interior Space</title>
      <p>
        Linear objects, like lines and segments, are one-dimensional. The only finite 
        one-dimensional object is a line segment which is bounded by two endpoints. Length
        can be thought of as the measurement of the interior space of a line segment, namely the 
        distance between the endpoints. In a linear space, all objects lie on a single line.
        we move only forward and backward along that line. There is no height or width.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two-dimensional geometry is the study of objects lying in a plane. Two-dimensional
        objects include polygons, circles, and other figures that can be drawn on a flat surface. 
        A closed two-dimenional figure 
        will be bounded by linear and/or curved segments that separate the interior of the 
        figure from the rest of the plane, which we refer to as the exterior of the figure. 
        The measure of the interior of a figure is called its area and involves both length
        and width. This second dimension, width, is measured in a direction perpendicular to  
        that of length. A plane will also include objects of smaller dimension, such as 
        one-dimensional lines and zero-dimensional points. We cannot measure the area of these 
        smaller dimensional objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        In three-dimensional geometry, we have length, width, and a third direction called 
        depth (or height). The geometrical solids studied in this section including prisms,
        cylinders, cones, pyramids, and polyhedra are examples of three-dimensional solids. 
        Each three-dimensional solid is bounded by surfaces which may include polygons, circles, 
        and other two-dimensional objects. The measurement of the interior space of a 
        geometrical solid is called volume.
      </p>
        <!--both the area and the perimeter of closed 
        finite two-dimensional objects. While the area of a planar figure requires 
        two dimensions, length and width, perimeter is actually a one-dimensional 
        measurement. Perimeter measures the boundary of the figure and one method 
        of finding the perimeter is to straighten out the boundary and lie it along 
        a ruler.
      </p>
      <p>
        With polyhedra and other three-dimensional solids, we can compute 
        volume and surface area. Volume measures the space inside whereas surface 
        area measures the boundary. For three-dimensional figures, the boundary 
        consists of surfaces. We can unfold the three-dimensional solid into its 
        two-dimensional net to compute and total the area of the surfaces. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For two-dimensional figures and three-dimensional solids, we have two 
        types of measurements. One type describes the space in the interior 
        of the object and the other computes the size of the object's boundary. 
        In both cases, the boundary of an object can be deconstructed and viewed 
        in a smaller dimension. Line segments, on the other hand, 
        have only one dimension, length. We can think of length as the linear space 
        between endpoints. Individual points have no length or breadth and cannot 
        be measured. Similarly, it does not make sense 
        to measure the <sq>boundary</sq> of a line segment.

              how perimeter is affected by stretching two-dimensional figures both 
              vertically and horizontally by the same amount. Can we make the same claim
