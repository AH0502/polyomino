  <title>Measuring in Different Dimensions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we complete our section on three-dimensional solids, let us take a closer 
      look at the relationships between measurements of one-, two-, and three-dimensional
      objects.
    </p>

      <title>Measuring Interior and Exterior Space</title>
      <p>
        Linear objects, like lines and segments, are one-dimensional. We measure 
        the lengths of segments. Linear objects have only length, not width.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two-dimensional objects include polygons, circles, and other figures that 
        lie in a plane. We can measure both the area and the perimeter of closed 
        finite two-dimensional objects. While the area of a planar figure requires 
        two dimensions, length and width, perimeter is actually a one-dimensional 
        measurement. Perimeter measures the boundary of the figure and one method 
        of finding the perimeter is to straighten out the boundary and lie it along 
        a ruler.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can find both the volume and the surface area of polyhedra and other 
        three-dimensional solids. Volume measures the space inside whereas surface 
        area measures the boundary. For three-dimensional figures, the boundary 
        consists of surfaces. We can unfold the three-dimensional solid into its 
        two-dimensional net. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For both two-dimensional figures and three-dimensional solids, we have two 
        types of measurements. One measures the space in the interior of the object 
        and the other measures the boundary of the object. In both cases, the boundary 
        consists of parts which live in a smaller dimension. One-dimensional objects 
        only have length which could be considered to be the linear space between
        endpoints, but points have no length or breadth and so it does not make sense 
        to measure the <sq>boundary</sq> of a line segment.

        How does the change in the length in one or more directions affect the 
        size of a figure's interior and boundary? We will see that in some cases 
        we see nice relationships while in other cases the relationship may be 
        less obvious if it even exists.
