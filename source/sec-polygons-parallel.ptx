    <title>What does Parallel Mean?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            What does it mean for two lines to be parallel? Remembering that lines continue
            indefinitely, we define two lines in the same plane to be <xref ref="def-parallel"
            text="custom">
            <term>parallel</term></xref> if they never intersect. In this section, we
            will look more closely at this definition, explore properties related to parallel lines,
            and explore what lines look like in other geometries.

        <title>Geometry on Another Surface</title>
        <p>
            In school, we typically consider lines to lie on a flat surface called a plane. While 
            most of this textbook will follow this tradition, we take a brief departure from planar 
            geometry in this section. The world we live on is not flat; it is roughly spherical. What 
            objects might act like lines on the surface of a sphere. Do spherical lines have the same 
            properties as lines on a plane? One 
            could also study the behavior of lines in our universe: Are they straight or do the bend? 
            What can we say about parallel lines in these environments? Do our familiar properties hold?

                    For this activity and the one that follows, 
                    you will need a small sphere, some rubber bands large enough to go around

                    include styrophone balls, oranges, rubber balls, or spheres sold by math education 
                    supply companies. Aim for a sphere around the size of a softball. A smooth 
                    surface is best, but any small ball will suffice. As an alternative, 
                    you may use a ribbon with a globe where latitude and longitude lines are marked.

                        We do not live on a plane; we live on a sphere.  
                        Let’s predict what the lines on a sphere, on our earth, might be.  
                        These lines will lie on the surface of the sphere.  
                        They will not pass through the sphere nor will they 
                        project out into space.  
                        What are some examples of things that might pose as “lines” on a sphere?  
                        Which of your descriptions in <xref ref="parallel-task-describe-line"/>

                        We shall use this property of line segment to determine which linear

                        Suppose you have plans to fly from Chicago, Illinois 
                        (41.8781N, 87.6298W), to Rome, Italy (41.9028N,12.4964E).  
                        There are many paths you could take; some might qualify as 
                        lines under your suggestions above. Which path gives the shortest 
                        distance from Chicago to Rome?  If a globe is available, find Chicago 
                        and Rome and experiment with a string to find the path of least distance.
                        If you do not have a globe, mark the approximate locations of Chicago and Rome 
                        on your sphere; each should be midway between the equator and the north pole,  
                        with Rome approximately a quarter of the way around east of Chicago. Tighten 
                        the string connecting these two cities to observe the path of shortest distance 
                        between them.

            The lines on a sphere are simply the great circles of the spheres.  A <term>great circle</term> 
            is a circle on a sphere that has the same diameter as the sphere itself.  
            If you were to cut a sphere along a great circle, you would split the circle into two 
            hemispheres of the same size.  Restrict yourself to this definition of line for the next

                The two explorations, <xref ref="parallel-explor-lines-sphere"/> and 
                <xref ref="parallel-explor-spherical-triangles"/> led to some observations that might 
                have surprised you. One of 
                the ways in which spherical geometry differs from Euclidean geometry is that no lines on 
                the sphere are parallel. Of course, we could have defined <term>line</term> differently, but 
                that would have led to a loss of other properties of lines, such as the existence and uniqueness 
                of a line joining any pair of points. Hence, we need to be clear regarding the geometry we  
                are working with. Except where specified, our study will be limited to Euclidean geometry 
                where lines lie on planes, not spheres. In Euclidean geometry, parallel lines do exist; in 
                fact, for each point and line not passing through that point, we can always draw exactly 
                one line that is parallel to the given line and passes through the given point. We will 
                accept this statement, known as Playfair's Parallel Postulate, as one of our principles.

                    In order to be parallel, two lines must lie in the same plane. If you are reading this indoors, 
                    you probably have a wall in front of you and a wall somewhere to your right. The line where the 
                    ceiling meets the wall in front of you will never intersect the line formed by the intersection of  
                    the floor and the wall to your right. Still, we do not consider these two lines to be parallel because  
                    there is no plane containing both lines. Instead, we say that these are <term>skew lines</term>.

                        Although it appears that the two lines meet on the right,
                        that is only a result of displaying a three-dimensional image on 
                        a two-dimensional surface. In reality, the top back line stays at 
                        the level of the ceiling and the lower front line stays on the floor.
                        They do not meet.

                We also observed that angle measures in spherical triangles did not behave in the way that Euclidean 
                triangles do. This  
                suggests that the measures of angles may be related to the parallel postulate. 
                Indeed the two concepts are closely connected. In <xref ref="subsec-polygons-angles-triangle"/>,
                we rotated a triangle 180 degrees about a midpoint of one of its 
                sides and again around the midpoint of a second side and noticed that copies of the three angles
                formed a line when placed side by side at a vertex. We now look at that exploration in the context of  
                parallelism.

            Were you surprised by that lines and triangles behave differently in spherical geometry? 
            You are not alone. Prior to 300 BC, 
            Greek scholars, including
            Thales, Pythagoras, Hippocrates, Eudoxus, Plato, and Socrates, developed the logic structure of
            Euclidean geometry.

                <p>
                   The Greeks were not alone in exploring geometry! In fact, they were familiar with 
                   geometrical calculation methods used by the Egyptions 
                   and Babylonians. There is evidence of geometric knowledge in Hindu, Chinese, and 
                </p>
            </aside>
        <p>
            This structure included a set of five postulates (like our principles) and rigorous
            proofs of geometrical properties from these postulates. Euclid compiled all of this work into a 
            thirteen-volume work called the <em>Elements</em>, produced around 300 B.C. This treatise included
            the proofs of 465 theorems deduced from just the five postulates and notions of equality and 
            inequality.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    If two lines are cut by a transversal line so that the sum of the measures 
                    of the interior angles on one side of the transversal is less than 180 degrees,
                    then the two lines will intersect on that side of the transversal.

             The first four postulates are straightforward and easy to accept, but the fifth postulate 
             is more complex and less intuitive. Over the centuries, mathematicians sought to prove the fifth postulate from 
             the first four. They found equivalent statements such as <xref ref="principle-Playfair">Playfair's Postulate</xref>, but could not 
             prove these statements from the first four postulates either. 
        </p>
        <p>
             At the beginning of the 18th century, geometers took a different tactic and began to explore 
             what would happen if this fifth postulate did not hold. This led to two alternative parallel  
             postulates, the elliptic parallel postulate and the hyperbolic parallel postulate.

             Each of these alternatives to the Euclidean Parallel Postulate, together with the first four 
             postulates, leads to a different geometry. Elliptical geometry is similar to what we worked with 
             on a sphere while hyperbolic geometry has a ruffled surface like that of a saddle or Pringle's 
             potato chip. In hyperbolic geometry, the sum of the angles in any triangle is less than 180 degrees; 
             whereas, we found the sum of the angles in a spherical (or elliptical) triangle to be greater than  
             180 degrees. The interested student is encouraged to consult other sources to learn more.
