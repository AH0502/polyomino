    <title>What Does Parallel Mean?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            What does it mean for two lines to be parallel? Remembering that lines continue
            indefinitely, we define two lines in the same plane to be <xref ref="def-parallel"
            text="custom">
            <term>parallel</term></xref> if they never intersect. In this section, we
            will look more closely at this definition, explore properties related to parallel lines,
            and explore what lines look like in other geometries.

                        of the measures of the angles in a triangle. They should give a 
                        variety of ideas on what parallelism means. For a later question,
                        we will use nonintersecting to define parallel lines.

        <title>Geometry on Another Surface</title>
        <p>
            In school, we typically consider lines to lie on a flat surface called a 
            plane. While most of this textbook will follow this tradition, we take a 
            brief departure from planar geometry in this section. The world we live on 
            is not flat; it is roughly spherical. What objects might act like lines on 
            the surface of a sphere? Do spherical lines have the same properties as 
            lines on a plane? One could also study the behavior of lines in our universe: 
            Are they straight or do they bend? What can we say about parallel lines in 
            these environments? Do our familiar properties hold?

                    For this activity and the one that follows, 
                    you will need a small sphere, some rubber bands large enough to go around

                    include styrofoam balls, oranges, rubber balls, or spheres sold by math education 
                    supply companies. Aim for a sphere around the size of a softball. A smooth 
                    surface is best, but any small ball will suffice. As an alternative, 
                    you may use a ribbon with a globe where latitude and longitude lines are marked.

                        We shall use this property of line segment to determine which linear

                        on your sphere; each should be midway between the equator and the North Pole,  
                        with Rome approximately a quarter of the way around east of Chicago. Tighten

            The lines on a sphere are simply the great circles.  A <term>great circle</term>

                Most likely, <xref ref="parallel-explor-lines-sphere"/> and 
                <xref ref="parallel-explor-spherical-triangles"/> led to some 
                observations that surprised you. One of the ways in which 
                spherical geometry differs from Euclidean geometry is that no lines on 
                the sphere are parallel. Of course, we could have defined <term>line</term> differently, but 
                that would have led to a loss of other properties of lines, such as the existence and uniqueness 
                of a line joining any pair of points. Hence, we need to be clear 
                regarding the geometry being studied.  
                Except where specified, our work will be limited to Euclidean geometry 
                where lines lie on planes, not spheres. In Euclidean geometry, 
                parallel lines exist. In fact, for each point <m>P</m> and line <m>\ell</m> 
                not passing through <m>P</m>, we can draw exactly 
                one line through <m>P</m> that is parallel to <m>\ell</m>. We will 
                accept this statement, known as Playfair's Parallel Postulate, 
                as one of our principles.

                    In order to be parallel, two lines must lie in the same plane. If you are reading this indoors, 
                    you probably have a wall in front of you and a wall somewhere to your right. The line where the 
                    ceiling meets the wall in front of you will never intersect the line formed by the intersection of  
                    the floor and the wall to your right. Still, we do not consider these two lines to be parallel because  
                    there is no plane containing both lines. Instead, we say that these are <term>skew lines</term>.

                        Although it appears that the two lines meet on the right,
                        that is only a result of displaying a three-dimensional image on 
                        a two-dimensional surface. In reality, the top back line stays at

                        They do not meet.

                We also observed that angle measures in spherical triangles did not behave in the way that Euclidean 
                triangles do. This suggests that the measures of angles may be 
                related to the parallel postulate. Indeed the two concepts are closely 
                connected. In <xref ref="subsec-polygons-angles-triangle"/>,
                we rotated a triangle 180 degrees about a midpoint of one of its 
                sides and again around the midpoint of a second side. We then observed 
                that the three angles formed a line when placed side by side at a 
                vertex. We now look at that exploration in the context of  
                parallelism.

            Were you surprised by that lines and triangles behave differently in spherical geometry? 
            You are not alone. Prior to 300 BC, 
            Greek scholars, including
            Thales, Pythagoras, Hippocrates, Eudoxus, Plato, and Socrates, developed the logic structure of
            Euclidean geometry.

                   The Greeks were not alone in exploring geometry! In fact, they were familiar with 
                   geometrical calculation methods used by the Egyptions 
                   and Babylonians. There is evidence of geometric knowledge in Hindu, Chinese, and

            </aside>
        <p>
            This structure included a set of five postulates (like our principles) and rigorous
            proofs of geometrical properties from these postulates. Euclid compiled all of this work into a 
            thirteen-volume work called the <em>Elements</em>, produced around 300 B.C. This treatise included
            the proofs of 465 theorems deduced from just the five postulates and notions of equality and 
            inequality.

                    If two lines are cut by a transversal line so that the sum of the measures

        <p>
             The first four postulates are straightforward and easy to accept, but the fifth postulate 
             is more complex and less intuitive. Over the centuries, mathematicians sought to prove the fifth postulate from 
             the first four. They found equivalent statements such as <xref ref="principle-Playfair">Playfair's Postulate</xref>, but could not 
             prove these statements from the first four postulates either. 
        </p>
        <p>
             At the beginning of the 18th century, geometers took a different tactic and began to explore 
             what would happen if this fifth postulate did not hold. This led to two alternative parallel  
             postulates, the elliptic parallel postulate and the hyperbolic parallel postulate.

             Each of these alternatives to the Euclidean Parallel Postulate, together with the first four 
             postulates, leads to a different geometry. Elliptical geometry is similar to what we worked with 
             on a sphere while hyperbolic geometry has a ruffled surface like that of a saddle or Pringle's 
             potato chip. In hyperbolic geometry, the sum of the angles in any triangle is less than 180 degrees; 
             whereas, we found the sum of the angles in a spherical (or elliptical) triangle to be greater than  
             180 degrees. The interested student is encouraged to consult other sources to learn more.

                <p>
                    The illustration in <xref ref="fig-Coxeterdisc-basic"/> was explored by mathematician
                    H. S. M. Coxeter and used by artist M. C. Escher as a basis for 
                    his Circle Limit series of prints. This illustration suggests another type 
                    of non-Euclidean geometry, a disc model of hyperbolic geometry. 
                    Here, lines are of two types: diameters of the outer disc and circular 
                    arcs that meet the outer disc at a right angle<fn>The tangents of these 
                    circles and the tangent of the outer disc at the point of intersection
                    are perpendicular.
                    </fn>. 
                </p>

                    In <xref ref="fig-escher-hypdisc"/>, line 
                    <m>\overleftrightarrow{AB}</m> is the curved arc<fn>We ignore the 
                        section outside the outer disc. It is include to show how these 
                        lines are parts of circles.
                    </fn> shown 
                    in orange about halfway between the top and the center, <m>C</m>,
                    of the outer disc. Point <m>D</m> is below the center on the 
                    same diameter as <m>B</m>; thus, <m>\overleftrightarrow{BD}</m> is that 
                    diameter. Line <m>\overleftrightarrow{FG}</m> has been drawn to illustrate
                    the fact that not all lines are visible in the design; in fact, given 
                    any two points in the interior of the disc, there is one and only one 
                    line passing through both points.

                    are vertices of a hexagon with center <m>C</m> with <m>A</m> and 
                    <m>B</m> being endpoints of a side of the hexagon.-->

                            Distance is measured differently in this geometry. The curved
                            triangular shapes near the edge that look tiny to our Euclidean 
                            eyes are actually congruent to the shapes near the center.
                            Lines actually continue indefinitely even though they are bounded 
                            by the edge of the disc.

                            be drawn. Do you think there are no lines, exactly one line, several
                            lines, or an infinite number of hyperbolic lines that 
                            pass through <m>C</m> and are parallel to <m>\overleftrightarrow{AB}</m>?

                    Write a letter to a friend in which you discuss some of the commonalities 
                    and differences between Euclidean and spherical geometry that you learned 
                    about in this section. As an optional 
                    extension, you might explore some other differences including whether 
                    spherical lines are infinite or finite and whether betweenness of points on 
                    spherical lines are preserved.
