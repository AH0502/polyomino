    <title>What does Parallel Mean?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            What does it mean for two lines to be parallel? Remembering that lines continue
            indefinitely, we defined two lines in the same plane to be <xref ref="def-parallel">
            <term>parallel</term></xref> if they never intersect. In this section, we
            will look more closely at this definition, explore properties related to parallel lines,
            and explore what lines look like in other geometries.

        <title>Geometry on Another Surface</title>
        <p>
            In school, we typically consider lines to lie on a flat surface called a plane. While 
            most of this textbook will follow this tradition, we take a brief departure from planar 
            geometry in this section. The world we live on is not flat; it is roughly spherical. One 
            could also study the behavior of lines in our universe: Are they straight or do the bend? 
            What can we say about parallel lines in these environments? Do our familiar properties hold?

            <introduction>
                <p>
                    For this activity, you will need a sphere, some rubber bands large enough to go around 
                    your sphere, a protractor, a marker, and a piece of thread. Possible <q>spheres</q> 
                    include styrophone balls, oranges, rubber softballs, or spheres sold by math education 
                    supply companies. Aim for a sphere around the size of a softball or larger.
