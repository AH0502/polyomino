        <p>
            The first exploratory activity should not require much of an introduction and 
            provides an opportunity for students to get to know a few classmates  
            and experience a tactile or visual learning experience 
            in a low-stress environment. Expectations of group work can begin 
            to be established. Although this activity may be done via applets embedded 
            within the online version of the textbook, I prefer to have my students
            complete this activity in small groups (three per group) with a worksheet 
            and graph paper. A handout for the inclass version 
            of this activity 
            is available 
            to instructors by request.<!--on the book website Also make sure that 
            the pdf version has tetromino and pentomino cut-outs-->. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I provide each group with a set of plastic pentominos only after 
            they have discovered most of them through experimentation. 
            Printable pentominoes that could be cut out can easily be found on 
            the web. For students completing this exploration in the online 
            textbook, I have hidden the last interactive inside the 
            hint to <xref ref="hiddenapp-pentominofilling"/>, so that the answer 
            to students will 
            take some time trying to create the twelve pentominos in 
            <xref ref="create-pentominoes"/> without having the answer immediately
            visible. For another option, this exploration 
            is available as a Desmos classroom activity, 
            <url href="teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/648a1bcce94034a3fecf0109"></url>. 
            however, the instructor may wish to break this up (make two copies to 
            edit) into two four-slide 
            activities so that the slides with the pentominoes will not be visible 
            too soon. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This activity also plays an important role in preparing students for much 
            of the work to come. We will build upon the basic principles about area, 
            <xref ref="area-meaning"/>, <xref ref="area-rect"/>, and 
            <xref ref="area-sums"/> as we compute areas of other shapes and as we 
            prove the Pythagorean theorem. We will also introduce additivity of 
            length, angle measure, and volume. These intuitive concepts have many 
            applications and connections.
            As part of the post-exploration discussion, you may want 
            to remind the students about how area is simply the number 
            of unit squares that fill the interior. It can be noted how 
            the area formula for a rectangle is easy to remember and related 
            to the operation for multiplication. We will be using 
            the fact that the total area is preserved when a figure is cut into 
            smaller figures and then rearranged to form a new figure. This principle 
            will be used to derive area formulas for other figures and to demonstrate 
            the universality of the Pythagorean Theorem.

           I often assign a math autobiography at the beginning of the semester and
           and have students refer back to it in their final portfolio. Students often 
           respond positively to the "Notice and Wonder" reflective writing assignment
           based on Eddie Wu's TedX talk, 
           <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXwStduNw14"/>
           <!--is this the same video?-->
        .
           The latter makes a good "snow day" activity. I have been less successful 
           with students' response to "A Mathematician's Lament" by Paul Lockhart. Many 
           students struggle to see how mathematics is like art, especially at the 
           beginning of the semester.
