            The first exploratory activity should not require much of an introduction and 
            provides an opportunity for students to get to know a few classmates  
            and experience a tactile or visual learning experience 
            in a low-stress environment. Expectations of group work can begin 
            to be established. In my classes, I begin without using technology 
            to encourage interaction providing groups with a set of pentominos after 
            they have discovered most of them. A handout for this activity 
            is available 
            to instructors by request<!--on the book website-->. Graph paper is useful 
            for discovering pentominoes when technology is not used. Printable pentominoes 
            that could be cut out can easily be found on the web.This exploration 
            is also available as a Desmos classroom activity, 
            <url href="teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/648a1bcce94034a3fecf0109"></url>.

            As part of the post-exploration discussion, you may want 
            to remind the students about how area is simply the number 
            of unit squares that fill the interior. It can be noted how 
            the area formula for a rectangle is easy to remember and related 
            to the operation for multiplication. In addition, we will be using 
            the fact that the total area is preserved when a figure is cut into 
            smaller figures and then rearranged to form a new figure. This principle 
            will be used to derive area formulas for other figures and to demonstrate 
            the universality of the Pythagorean Theorem.
