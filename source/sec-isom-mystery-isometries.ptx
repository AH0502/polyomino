    <introduction>
        <p>
            Given two congruent figures, what is the isometry that maps one 
            onto the other? In this section, we will learn how to identify the
            type of isometry for this mapping and 
            to construct the axis of a reflection, the center and 
            angle of a rotation, and a vector of a translation or glide 
            reflection.

            <p>
                We know that an isometry is a transformation (or function) that 
                preserves the measures of lines and angles.  The original object and its 
                image under an isometry are always congruent to each other.  It turns out 
                if we are given any two congruent figures in the plane there is an isometry 
                that maps one of the figures onto the other.  At the end of this section, 
                you will be given a pair of congruent figures and then will determine the 
                associated isometry using the properties you identified in the early part of 
                the lab.

                        Orientation is a good way of distinguishing between types of 
                        isometries, especially rotations and glide reflections.
