    <title>Mystery Isometries</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this sectopm, we will review the four types of isometries, 
            reflections, translations, rotations, and glide reflections, and 
            learn how to construct the axis of a reflection, the center and 
            angle of a rotation, and a vector of a translation or glide 
            reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
            We know that an isometry is a transformation (or function) that 
            preserves the measures of lines and angles.  The original object and its 
            image under an isometry are always congruent to each other.  It turns out 
            if we are given any two congruent figures in the plane there is an isometry 
            that maps one of the figures onto the other.  At the end of this section, 
            you will be given a pair of congruent figures and then will determine the 
            associated isometry using the properties you identified in the early part of 
            the lab.
        </p>
        <p>
            Orientation is a good way of distinguishing between types of 
            isometries, especially rotations and glide reflections.
