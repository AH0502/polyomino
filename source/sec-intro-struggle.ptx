    <title>Invitation to Overcome Challenges </title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Have you ever watched a baby learn a new skill, like walking, crawling, or even 
        rolling over? The child does not master the skill on the first try, but they are 
        determined. They fall down, but they keep trying. They readjust what they are doing, 
        figure out how to create momentum and balance, and finally succeed. Even then they 
        may stumble, but they persist. In the process, they grow stronger and can apply these  
        skills to later learning, like running, climbing the cabinets, reaching the cookie jar.

        Throughout our lives, we grow by challenging ourselves to move beyond our comfort zone. 
        We learn to read and write, to play games and sports, to cook, make music, or other art. 
        Our brains are muscles that develop as we attempt new challenges. That the 
        nature of mathematics involves struggling with a problem, trying different 
        strategies, taking breaks but persisting. In the explorations in this section, 
        you will find that some of the problems are easy, but others require looking at 
        the problem in new ways and trying different strategies.

      <title>Triangles on a Geoboard</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this exploration, we will work with a geoboard that has four rows 
          and four columns of pins such as the one pictured below.

            Refer to the picture of the <m>4\times 4</m>-geoboard above as you 
            answer the questions.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Measuring along any row, we will assume that the horizontal 
                distance between neighboring dots on a geoboard is one unit. 
                What is the distance across the top of the geoboard from the leftmost 
                pin to the rightmost pin?

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Similarly, the vertical distance between neighboring pins in any 
                column will be one unit. Determine the area of the square whose vertices 
                are the four outermost pins on this geoboard.

                Determine the shortest diagonal distance between two pins. In other
                words, what is the distance from the pin in the upper left corner to 
                the pin in the second row and second column?

            As we construct triangles and other shapes on our geoboard, note that 
            each vertex must be one one of the sixteen pins.

            On each geoboard below, construct a square with an area different than 
            any square you've already drawn. Counting the triangles you drew in 
            <xref ref="lgst-4x4geobd-tri"/>, it is possible to create a total of eight 
            triangles each with a different area.
