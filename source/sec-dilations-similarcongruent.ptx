        <title>Congruent Triangles</title>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="def-congruent-polygon"/>, we defined two polygons to be 
          congruent if corresponding angles and corresponding sides were congruent.
          For a triangle, one would need to check three pairs of angles and three 
          pairs of sides, a total of twelve measurements to verify congruence. For 
          other polygons, even more measurements would be required. Intuitively,
          we would like to think of two figures being congruent if there is an 
          isometry that takes one to the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most high school geometry courses devote a significant amount of time to 
          triangle congruence criteria, including SAS (Side-Angle-Side), SSS (Side-Side-Side), and
          ASA (Angle-Side-Angle). Each of these reduces the number of objects that 
          need to be checked for congruence in half. We will assume the SAS Congruence 
          Criterion as a Principle and add it to our toolbox.

          <title>SAS Triangle Congruence</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              If two triangles have two pairs of congruent corresponding sides and
              the corresponding angles between these sides are also congruent, then the triangles 
              are congruent. In particular, if <m>\Delta ABC</m> and <m>\Delta DEF</m>
              have <m>AB=DE</m> and <m>BC=EF</m> and <m>\angle ABC\cong\angle DEF</m>,
              then <m>\Delta ABC\cong\Delta DEF</m>. 
            </p>
          </statement>
        </principle>
        <p>
          A second congruence criterion, SSS, can be proved from SAS, but requires many steps 
          that I have elected to move to optional exercises rather than making the proof 
          required. We add this criterion to our set of tools as well.
        </p>

            <p>
              If two triangles have three pairs of congruent corresponding sides, then the triangles 
              are congruent. In particular, if <m>\Delta ABC</m> and <m>\Delta DEF</m>
              have <m>AB=DE</m>, <m>BC=EF</m>, and <m>AC=DF</m>,
              then <m>\Delta ABC\cong\Delta DEF</m>.

          It is intuitively obvious that reflecting a point <m>A</m> across a 
          line <m>m</m> will result in a point <m>A'</m> where <m>m</m> is the 
          perpendicular bisector of <m>AA'</m>. It may be more surprising that
          if <m>C</m> is any point on line <m>m</m> then <m>AC=A'C</m>. In other
          words, every point on the reflecting line <m>m</m> is <term>equidistant</term>
          from <m>A</m> and <m>A'</m>. We prove this in <xref ref="explor-perpbis"/>.

  <p>
    In this section, I plan to add information on the relationship between 
    congruency of figures and isometries. We will add SAS and SSS to our toolbox,
    probably as assumed principles. Will this need to be in <xref ref="ch-isom"/>
    instead? 
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, we will look at similar triangles and add AAA to our toolbox.
    Will other similarity criteria be needed for later work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Efforts will be made to use a transformational, exploratory approach to the 
    extent possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    This notion 
        of congruence as being able to lay one figure on top of the other was how Euclid 
        envisioned congruence. This intuitive definition of congruence preceded
        the more technical measurement definitions for congruence taught in many 
        middle and high school geometry classes. There has been a shift back to 
        this transformational meaning of congruent in recent years. Perhaps, your 
        teacher adopted this approach.
