  <title>Similarity and Congruence</title>
<p>
  UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
</p>
  <p>
    In this section, I plan to add information on the relationship between 
    congruency of figures and isometries. We will add SAS and SSS to our toolbox,
    probably as assumed principles. Will this need to be in <xref ref="ch-isom"/>
    instead? 
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, we will look at similar triangles and add AAA to our toolbox.
    Will other similarity criteria be needed for later work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Efforts will be made to use a transformational, exploratory approach to the 
    extent possible.
