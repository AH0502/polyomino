        <title>Congruent Triangles</title>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="def-congruent-polygon"/>, we defined two polygons to be 
          congruent if corresponding angles and corresponding sides were congruent.
          For a triangle, one would need to check three pairs of angles and three 
          pairs of sides, a total of twelve measurements to verify congruence. For 
          other polygons, even more measurements would be required. Intuitively,
          we would like to think of two figures being congruent if there is an 
          isometry that takes one to the other.

          Most high school geometry courses devote a significant amount of time to 
          triangle congruence criteria, including SAS (Side-Angle-Side), SSS (Side-Side-Side), and
          ASA (Angle-Side-Angle). Each of these reduces the number of objects that 
          need to be checked for congruence in half. We will assume the SAS Congruence 
          Criterion as a Principle and add it to our toolbox.

          <statement>
            <p>
              If two triangles have two pairs of congruent corresponding sides and
              the corresponding angles between these sides are also congruent, then the triangles 
              are congruent. In particular, if <m>\Delta ABC</m> and <m>\Delta DEF</m>
              have <m>AB=DE</m> and <m>BC=EF</m> and <m>\angle ABC\cong\angle DEF</m>,
              then <m>\Delta ABC\cong\Delta DEF</m>.

        </principle>
        <p>
          A second congruence criterion, SSS, can be proved from SAS, but requires many steps 
          that I have elected to move to optional exercises rather than making the proof 
          required. We add this criterion to our set of tools as well.

          <title>Constructing Perpendicular Bisectors</title>
          <p>
            To find the mirror of a reflection or the center of a rotation, we 
            needed to create perpendicular bisectors of segments. While GeoGebra 
            does this when we are working with line segments online, how was this 
            done prior to technology? How can we find perpendicular bisectors for 
            lines on paper?
          </p>
          <p>
            Actually, it is not difficult to find a perpendicular bisector when the 
            segment is drawn on a sheet of paper. We simply fold the paper so that 
            the two endpoints line up. The fold line will then be the perpendicular
            bisector of the segment. Of course, we may need to darken the endpoints or 
            hold the paper up to light in order to create the correct fold.
          </p>
          <exercise>
            <statement>
              <p>
                Draw a segment on a sheet of paper and check that this process works!
                Are the angles right angles? Does the fold pass through the midpoint of 
                the segment?
              </p>
            </statement>
          </exercise>
          <p>
            But geometry has been around longer than paper! How would the early geometers
            create perpendicular bisectors without folding their tablets? They would use 
            a compass and straight edge to construct geometrical objects. This geometrical 
            compass allowed them to create circles and the straight edge was for connecting 
            points with lines or segments. These tools had no markings on them; the compass
            enabled lengths to be copied so that measurements were not needed.
          </p>
          <!--Add picture of compass and straight edge.-->
          <p>
            In <xref ref="expl-compass-perpbis"/>, we will use handheld and digital 
            compasses and straight edges to construct the perpendicular bisector of 
            a segment.

                <p>
                  For this task, you will need a sheet of paper, a 
                  pencil, a compass, and a straight edge tool. The paper
                  may be in a notebook or in a pad.

                    The instructions that follow assume that you are using a 
                    compass with a pointed arm and a pencil arm. If you are using
                    a flat compass, you will use your finger to hold the rotational 
                    center (pivot) in place and use the slider to align and hold 
                    the pencil.

                    On the sheet of paper, draw two points about a fist's 
                    distance apart and about a third of the way down the sheet. 
                    Label the points as <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Use your straight 
                    edge to draw segment <m>\overline{AB}</m>.

                    To find the perpendicular bisector of <m>\overline{AB}</m>,
                    we hold the pointed arm (pivot) of the compass firmly on 
                    point <m>A</m> and adjust the compass so that the pencil is on 
                    point <m>B</m>. Rotate the compass to draw a circle with center
                    <m>A</m> that passes through point <m>B</m>.

                    <p>
                      Your circle may extend beyond the sheet of paper. That is  
                      okay so long as you have drawn enough of the circle both above 
                      and below where you anticipate the midpoint of the segment to be.

                    Putting a piece of cardboard or additional sheets of paper
                    underneath the sheet of paper will help hold the pivot in place
                    as you rotate. Hold the pivot securely and let the pencil rotate
                    lightly. You can even rotate the paper instead of the compass.

                    Move the pivot to <m>B</m> and hold it down securely. Check that
                    the pencil is at point <m>A</m>. Then rotate to draw part of the 
                    center of the circle with center <m>B</m> that passes through <m>A</m>.
                    In particular, you should draw where this circle intersects the 
                    first circle, both above and below the segment. If you did not draw 
                    enough of the first circle, you should redraw it so that the
                    intersections are visible.

  <p>
    In this section, I plan to add information on the relationship between 
    congruency of figures and isometries. We will add SAS and SSS to our toolbox,
    probably as assumed principles. Will this need to be in <xref ref="ch-isom"/>
    instead? 
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, we will look at similar triangles and add AAA to our toolbox.
    Will other similarity criteria be needed for later work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Efforts will be made to use a transformational, exploratory approach to the 
    extent possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    This notion 
        of congruence as being able to lay one figure on top of the other was how Euclid 
        envisioned congruence. This intuitive definition of congruence preceded
        the more technical measurement definitions for congruence taught in many 
        middle and high school geometry classes. There has been a shift back to 
        this transformational meaning of congruent in recent years. Perhaps, your 
        teacher adopted this approach.
