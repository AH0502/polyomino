  <title>Similarity and Congruence</title>
<p>
  UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
</p>
  <p>
    In this section, I plan to add information on the relationship between 
    congruency of figures and isometries. We will add SAS and SSS to our toolbox,
    probably as assumed principles. Will this need to be in <xref ref="ch-isom"/>
    instead? 
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, we will look at similar triangles and add AAA to our toolbox.
    Will other similarity criteria be needed for later work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Efforts will be made to use a transformational, exploratory approach to the 
    extent possible.

  <!--<p>
    This notion 
        of congruence as being able to lay one figure on top of the other was how Euclid 
        envisioned congruence. This intuitive definition of congruence preceded
        the more technical measurement definitions for congruence taught in many 
        middle and high school geometry classes. There has been a shift back to 
        this transformational meaning of congruent in recent years. Perhaps, your 
        teacher adopted this approach.
