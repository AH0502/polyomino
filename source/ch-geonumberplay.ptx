    <title>Exploring Patterns in Geometry and Numbers</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            While much of this textbook has focused on exploring the whys behind
            classical geometry, the subject of geometry is much broader and continues 
            to grow. In this section, we will look at a few topics outside the standard
            curriculum, observe patterns, and test conjectures. We will also appreciate
            some connections between number sense and geometry.
