    <title>Introduction to Geometrical Thinking</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Geometry is all around us, in nature, in architecture, in art,
        in games, and in technology. Throughout history, humans have 
        marveled upon geometrical patterns, investigated possibilities, 
        developed geometrical tools, and shared these discoveries with 
        others. Mathematicians use logic to confirm what they appear to 
        see and to convince other scholars. Over time, the study of geometry 
        evolved to the collection of axioms, theorems, and formulas that you 
        may have studied in previous classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these formulas and theorems are worth knowing well: basic area and volume 
        formulas, the Pythagorean theorem, for example, arise frequently in applications and 
        conversation. You will appear more literate if you can use them. However, 
        memorization and application is not the primary goal of this course. 
        After all, search engines, calculators, and artificial intelligence can provide us with formulas
        and perform calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of greater worth, is the ability to see the mathematics around 
        us, to ask questions and seek understanding, to imagine and create, 
        and to share our knowledge with others. In this first chapter and 
        throughout the book, you will be encouraged to practice mathematical 
        habits of mind that will enable you to learn new ideas and delve deeper 
        into familiar topics. Many of the geometrical ideas explored in this introductory 
        chapter will be revisited later in the course.

          This class may be different from many of the mathematics classes you have 
          taken in the past.  You will be encouraged to explore geometrical ideas, 
          solve puzzles, make conjectures, discuss with classmates, make connections 
          between ideas, explain your solutions, and justify your reasoning.  You 
          should not expect to be shown how to do problems by the instructions. In 
          fact, there may not be one, single right way to complete some of the 
          problems but rather many acceptable ways of coming to a solution.  Your 
          teacher will encourage you to share these alternative approaches with the 
          class. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps this course would be easier for you if you were simply told 
          how to solve the problems, but the objective of this course is not 
          to learn facts and methods, but rather to develop your mathematical 
          thinking and communication skills.  In this technological age, 
          computers can do many of the algorithms and processes that used to 
          be the core of mathematics education, but they have not replaced man’s 
          role of developing strategies to solve problems and recognizing when 
          mathematics can be applied to real world situations.  Developing these 
          reasoning skills will help you more in your future than simply being able 
          to quote the Pythagorean Theorem. On the other hand, it is still useful to 
          know the Pythagorean Theorem so that you are able to recognize when it can 
          (and cannot) be used to solve both elementary and complex problems.  This 
          theorem along with some other basic formulas you have learned in the past 
          (and can look up online) form a toolbox for our work, but we will give more 
          emphasis to the creative process that is mathematics.

        <p>
          In <q>A Mathematician’s Lament</q> Paul Lockhart describes a nightmare 
          in which music was taught in the same way that mathematics is currently 
          taught.<!--~\cite{lament}-->  He says, 
        </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Mathematics is the music of reason. To do mathematics is to engage in an act of discovery and conjecture, 
              intuition and inspiration; to be in a state of confusion— not because it 
              makes no sense to you, but because you gave it sense and you still don’t 
              understand what your creation is up to; to have a breakthrough idea; to 
              be frustrated as an artist; to be awed and overwhelmed by an almost painful 
              beauty; to be alive.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              If we were to teach music via lecture and mere recall, 
              focusing on the notation and structure, but not allowing students to experience 
              and create music, the subject would be dry and uninteresting, the creative 
              process would be stifled, and very few would have an interest in learning 
              music.  Yet, that is what we have done with much of our mathematics instruction.  
              We have removed both the exploration and the fun. 
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        <p>
          So I encourage you to embrace the experience that is mathematics.  
          Approach each puzzle with an open mind, make guesses as to what is 
          happening, and experiment to determine whether your ideas are correct.  
          Play with the materials and the concepts and ask new questions.  In this 
          course, you might even be invited to explore a question you posed instead 
          of the one the teacher originally posed!  Mathematics is not just about finding the answer; 
          even when there is an answer, our work should evoke new questions: Why? What else?
