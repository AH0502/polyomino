    <title>Introduction to Geometrical Thinking</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Geometry is all around us, in nature, in architecture, in art,
        in games, and in technology. Throughout history, humans have 
        marveled upon geometrical patterns, investigated possibilities, 
        developed geometrical tools, and shared these discoveries with 
        others. Mathematicians use logic to confirm what they appear to 
        see and to convince other scholars. Over time, the study of geometry 
        evolved to the collection of axioms, theorems, and formulas that you 
        may have studied in previous classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these formulas and theorems are worth knowing well: basic area and volume 
        formulas, the Pythagorean theorem, for example, arise frequently in applications and 
        conversation. You will appear more literate if you can use them. However, 
        memorization and application is not the primary goal of this course. 
        After all, search engines, calculators, and artificial intelligence can provide us with formulas
        and perform calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of greater worth, is the ability to see the mathematics around 
        us, to ask questions and seek understanding, to imagine and create, 
        and to share our knowledge with others. In this first chapter and 
        throughout the book, you will be encouraged to practice mathematical 
        habits of mind that will enable you to learn new ideas and delve deeper 
        into familiar topics. Many of the geometrical ideas explored in this introductory 
        chapter will be revisited later in the course.

        <p>
        Why do we study geometry? Geometry is one of the oldest fields of study and
        one of the most useful. Give examples. Talk about integration between algebra 
        and geometry.
        
        </p>

        <p>
        What to expect in this class: Talk about the focus on the why behind the how. 
        Discuss benefits of open-ended exploration. Mention the use of our toolkit.

        <exercise>
          <statement>
            <p> What is the derivative of <m>f(x)=\frac{x^2+1}{x}</m>? </p>
          </statement>
          <hint>
            <p>
              Rewrite the fraction before taking the derivative.
