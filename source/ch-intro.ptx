        <p>
        Why do we study geometry? Geometry is one of the oldest fields of study and
        one of the most useful. Give examples. Talk about integration between algebra 
        and geometry.

        <p>
        What to expect in this class: Talk about the focus on the why behind the how. 
        Discuss benefits of open-ended exploration. Mention the use of our toolkit.

        <exercise>
          <statement>
            <p> What is the derivative of <m>f(x)=\frac{x^2+1}{x}</m>? </p>
          </statement>
          <hint>
            <p>
              Rewrite the fraction before taking the derivative.
