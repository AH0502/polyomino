  <title>Geometry on a Billiard Table</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        In this section, we explore the path of a billiard ball as it travels around a 
        rectangular pool table and determine which pocket the ball will land in. Throughout
        this section, we assume that there is no spin on the ball so that it travels in a  
        straight line; it encounters no bumps, fuzz, or other impediments as it travels. 
        We also assume that the ball has no resistance and will continue to 
        travel until in lands 
        in one of the corner pockets. Once again, we will see a connection between geometry 
        and properties of the set of counting numbers.

    <title>The Law of Reflection</title>
    <p>
        Though we describe this as billiard ball geometry, the behavior of our ideal ball is
        more like light hitting mirrors.
