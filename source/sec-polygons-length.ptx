    <title>Exploring Length and the Pythagorean Theorem</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        Dating from before 500 B.C., the Pythagorean Theorem allows us to 
        compute lengths associated with right triangles.  
        Upon completing this section, you should be able to explain to 
        others how the Pythagorean Theorem follows from our basic principles.
        First, we introduce some terminology and refresh our memory on how to 
        apply the theorem.

        As noted in 
        <xref ref="def-triangles-by-angles"/>, a <term>right triangle</term>
        is a triangle with one right angle. The longest side, called the 
        <term>hypotenuse</term>, of a right triangle
        is always opposite the right angle. The other two sides of the right 
        triangle are called the <term>legs</term>.
