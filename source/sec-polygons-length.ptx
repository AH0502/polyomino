    <title>Exploring Length and the Pythagorean Theorem</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        Dating from before 500 B.C., the Pythagorean Theorem allows us to 
        compute lengths associated with right triangles.  
        Upon completing this section, you should be able to explain to 
        others how the Pythagorean Theorem follows from our basic principles.
        First, we introduce some terminology and refresh our memory on how to 
        apply the theorem.

        As noted in

        is a triangle with one right angle. The longest side, called the 
        <term>hypotenuse</term>, of a right triangle
        is always opposite the right angle. The other two sides of the right 
        triangle are called the <term>legs</term>.

  <title>The Pythagorean Theorem</title>
  <p>
    The Pythagorean Theorem states that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the lengths of
    the sides of a right triangle and <m>c</m> is the length of the hypotenuse,
    then <m>a^2+b^2=c^2</m>. The next set of questions will refresh your skill in 
    using the Pythagorean Theorem to determine missing lengths.

  <title>Proving the Pythagorean Theorem with Picture Puzzles</title>
  <p>
    The Pythagorean Theorem is very useful, but it is also somewhat mysterious.
    Why does the formula work for all right triangles? Surprisingly, there are 
    more than 350 recognized proofs of the Pythagorean. We will look at just a few. 
    In the following exploration,
    you will rearrange polygons built from a right triangle,
    and use the rearrangements to explain why 
    <m>a^2+b^2=c^2</m> in each case. You are encouraged to try all the proofs and to 
    choose one to learn well enough to convince others.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p>
      The book, The Pythagorean Proposition, by Elisha S. Loomis, (NCTM:1968) 
      contains 367 proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. 
      <!--also he published a nonproof in 1901.-->

            Look at the two ways in which you filled the square frames and the expressions

              An alternative is to use just the first puzzle and more algebra to prove the 
              Pythagorean Theorem. This is acceptable, but Education majors may appreciate 
              that the method of using both puzzles together can be used to convince third graders.
