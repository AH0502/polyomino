    <title>Polyhedra</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        In this chapter, we will explore three-dimensional solids. Solids with 
        flat polygonal sides, like cubes and pyramids, are called polyhedra.
        Other solids, like cylinders and spheres have curved faces.

    <p>
        To fully understand this chapter, you will need to construct some of 
        these figures. Be prepared to print copies of patterns on paper or cardstock 
        so that you can fold and tape the figures together as needed.
