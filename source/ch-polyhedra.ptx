    <title>Exploring Polyhedra</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
        Most of the geometry we have studied thus far has been on a flat surface
        called a plane. While planar geometry is easier to draw, it is not the world 
        we live in. All physical objects, including boxes, rooms, chairs, pets, and
        humans, have length, width, and height.

        The sculptor creates art in a three-dimensional world while the painter
        projects an image of the three-dimensional world onto a flat, two-dimensional 
        canvas. Similarly, images in this section have been projected from 
        three-dimensional space to the two-dimensional computer screen or book. 
        This projection may distort shapes and angles.
        Constructing objects or finding examples in your surroundings may 
        be helpful as you seek to understand the geometry of our world.

        Who needs to study three-dimensional geometry? The architect designing 
        a building, the animator bringing characters to life on the screen, 
        the doctor analyzing the size and shape of a tumor, the home gardener 
        ordering soil and mulch, the astronomer studying our universe, pilots and 
        air traffic controllers navigating our skies, and retailers and wholesalers 
        managing supply are just a few examples.
