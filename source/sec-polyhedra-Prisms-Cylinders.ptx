            Let us explore the geometric solid known as a <term>prism</term> in 
            greater detail. As noted in <xref ref="def-prism"/>, a prism is a 
            box-like geometric solid with a pair of congruent and parallel polygonal  
            faces, the base and the summit, joined by a band of parallelograms.
            The number of parallelograms connecting the bases will always equal 
            the number of sides of a base.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are most familiar with <term>right prisms</term>, namely prisms 
            where the bases meet all the side faces at right angles; the side faces of a 
            right prism are rectangles. A <term>skew prism</term> is a prism with 
            at least one side face is not a rectangle.

            Although a cylinder is not a polyhedron since it has a circular 
            base, we will see that there are some similarities between prisms and
            cylinders. Both have parallel, congruent bases.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    What shape(s) join the parallel circles in a cylinder? How many 
                    are there?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
                <p>
                    Cut out pieces of paper to cover a cylindrical can. In addition to 
                    the two circles, what else do you need?
                </p>
            </hint>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    The two circles are joined by a single rectangle. The width of this 
                    rectangle equals the circumference of a circular end.

            An important measurement for prisms and cylinders is the distance between 
            the bases. Many geometry textbooks use the term <term>height</term> to 
            describe this distance.
        </p>
        <definition xml:id="def-height-prism">
            <idx><h>height</h><h>prism</h></idx>
            <idx><h>stretch</h></idx>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    The <term>height</term> of a prism or cylinder is the distance between the 
                    parallel congruent bases and is measured along a line perpendicular to the 
                    bases. When a prism or cylinder is sitting on a side other than a
                    base, the height will be measured laterally instead of vertically. In fact, 
                    this text will use the word <term>stretch</term> in lieu of <sq>height</sq> where 
                    confusion may occur. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The height or stretch of a right prism is usually measured along an 
                    edge of one of the rectangular sides, like <m>d</m> in <xref ref="fig-right-prism"/>.
                    The stretch of a skew prism, on the other hand, 
                    will be less than the height of a side face as illustrated in 
                    <xref ref="fig-skew-prism"/>.
