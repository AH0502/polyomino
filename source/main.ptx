      This textbook is designed to engage prospective 
      elementary and early childhood teachers with exploratory 
      actives that lead them to a deeper understanding of 
      the geometry that they will be teaching. At the same time, the textbook is 
      written in a style that does not limit its use to 
      education majors. Students in Business, Psychology, and
      Liberal Arts programs have taken the course and connected 
      their learning to their chosen majors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concepts of area, polygons, geometrical solids, and transformations
      are explored in depth and serve as the foundation for 
      further study. Instead of a formulaic approach to proof-writing,
      students are asked to write explanatory letters to a friend and 
      guided to incorporating illustrations in their explanations.
    </p>
      <p>
      The textbook includes a mix of interactive activities and 
      open-ended explorations. Many of these are embedded 
      GeoGebra and PolyPad applets, most created by the author.
      Other activities are tactile, using manipulatives, geometrical
      tools, and inexpensive office supplies. Often an option of 
      completing tasks either digitally or tactilely is provided.

        My hope is to continue improving the book, releasing a new edition each spring 
        in time for fall adoptions.  These new editions will incorporate additions and 
        corrections suggested by instructors and students who use the text the previous 
        semesters.
        Thus I encourage you to send along any corrections, suggestions, and comments 
        as you have them.

      The author is writing this textbook during a 2023-2024 sabbatical. Updates and 
      additions will be deployed every week or two to 
      <url href=" https://tjmagnus.github.io/polyomino/"/>. Suggestions on how to improve
      this textbook are appreciated.

      An Instructor's Version is available to faculty upon request. Email the author at

      <title>Exploration activities</title>
      <p permid="QBD">
        Explorations are an essential part of this course. Students, often in groups, make  
        sense of the mathematics and take ownership of the content by discovering relationships 
        through hands-on activities. I am happy to share the classroom worksheets  
        on which this course is based. In fact, I plan to continue to use handouts for 
        most of the inclass explorations even after this textbook is complete. I plan  
        to add many of these to an instructor-accessible  
        website. Instructors wanting to use these sooner should email me!

      <p permid="pen">
        For those of you reading this in a PDF or in print, I encourage you to also check out 
        the interactive online version, which makes navigating the book a little easier.  
        Additionally, many of the activities are implemented as GeoGebra or Polypad applets, 
        which allow you to work interactively inside the textbook. Some exercises can be checked 
        inside the online textbook and hyperlinks to definitions and other items are included. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My hope is to add other features, like how-to-use-the-software videos, in the future.
        You can view the interactive version for free at 
        <url href=" https://tjmagnus.github.io/polyomino/"/><!--or by scanning the
