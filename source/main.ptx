      ask questions, grow, and celebrate success has helped me revise these activities 
      and translate them into book form. I especially want to thank my student editors,
      Sarah Frazier, Elisabeth Jacob, and Caitlyn St. Cyr gave the work a thorough reading

        This book is designed to engage students in the art and excitement of doing mathematics:
        of being curious, exploring possibilities, observing patterns, making 
        conjectures, and justifying claims. Active play and discovery has been an 
        important part of my own mathematical journey and continues to be an essential 
        part of the field of mathematics. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that all students can do mathematics if given the opportunity. 
        Creative problem solving should not be limited to honors or upper-level 
        courses as all students benefit from it. Problems can and should be chosen
        to be accessible yet intriguing. I visited kindergarten classes where 
        students were enthusiastic about patterns and numbers, eagerly wanting to 
        share their thoughts and try new things. As a university professor, I wanted 
        to know more about why this enthusiasm and confidence dissipates by the 
        time they reach my classes. I also made it my mission to share the joy of 
        mathematical exploration with my students, especially those considering a 
        career in education. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Many resources have mathematical tasks and problems available for students
        to explore. Noncurricular puzzles, games, applications, and fun topics are 
        great ways to encourage teamwork, creativity, and reasoning, but a mathematics 
        course needs to have purpose and cohesion as well. In developing my course, I 
        challenged myself to choose, sequence, and tailor activities so that 
        students would develop and build upon foundational knowledge. I responded to 
        students' questions and discoveries, led discussions to emphasize key ideas, 
        and investigated misconceptions. 
        As I write this textbook, I have to anticipate how others might use the book 
        and include more detail than I need in my own classroom. Some activities 
        have more scaffolding to ensure that essential material is uncovered and I 
        have added introductory and summary reading to focus and support learning.
        I hope that this detail and structure still allows for differing strategies,
        rich discussion, and the thrill of discovery. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Geometry is one of the original liberal arts,  
      </p>
      I am also mindful of 
        our state's cerfication expectations for educators. 
      <p>
        While concepts and skills are important, the overemphasis on rote memorization,
        demonstration of techniques, skills practice, and easily-scored problems has 
        removed the joy in mathematics education. Despite the fact that some of the 
        most treasured mathematical results took years<mdash>even centuries</mdash> to 
        be established, our society has emphasized speed or contemplation. Most 
        students (and adults) have lost confidence in their ability to do mathematics. 
        They spend very little time thinking about problems and instead rely on their 
        teachers to provide information and demonstrate methods. They search for examples
        to mimic instead of creating strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The material in this textbook is accessible
      </p>
    <p>
      This textbook is designed to engage prospective 
      elementary and early childhood teachers with exploratory 
      actives that lead them to a deeper understanding of 
      the geometry that they will be teaching. At the same time, the textbook is 
      written in a style that does not limit its use to 
      education majors. Students in Business, Psychology, and
      Liberal Arts programs have taken the course and connected 
      their learning to their chosen majors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concepts of area, polygons, geometrical solids, and transformations
      are explored in depth and serve as the foundation for 
      further study. Instead of a formulaic approach to proof-writing,
      students are asked to write explanatory letters to a friend and 
      guided to incorporating illustrations in their explanations.
    </p>
      <p>
      The textbook includes a mix of interactive activities and 
      open-ended explorations. Many of these are embedded 
      GeoGebra and PolyPad applets, most created by the author.
      Other activities are tactile, using manipulatives, geometrical
      tools, and inexpensive office supplies. Often an option of 
      completing tasks either digitally or tactilely is provided.

      <p>
        My hope is to continue improving the book, releasing a new edition each spring 
        in time for fall adoptions.  These new editions will incorporate additions and 
        corrections suggested by instructors and students who use the text the previous 
        semesters.
        Thus I encourage you to send along any corrections, suggestions, and comments 
        as you have them.

    <title>How to use this book</title>
    <p>
      The author is writing this textbook during a 2023-2024 sabbatical. Updates and 
      additions will be deployed every week or two to 
      <url href=" https://tjmagnus.github.io/polyomino/"/>. Suggestions on how to improve
      this textbook are appreciated.

      <title>Exploration activities</title>
      <p>
        Explorations are an essential part of this course. Students, often in groups, make  
        sense of the mathematics and take ownership of the content by discovering relationships 
        through hands-on activities. I am happy to share the classroom worksheets  
        on which this course is based. In fact, I plan to continue to use handouts for 
        most of the inclass explorations even after this textbook is complete. I plan  
        to add many of these to an instructor-accessible  
        website. Instructors wanting to use these sooner should email me!

      <p>
        For those of you reading this in a PDF or in print, I encourage you to also check out 
        the interactive online version, which makes navigating the book a little easier.  
        Additionally, many of the activities are implemented as GeoGebra or Polypad applets, 
        which allow you to work interactively inside the textbook. Some exercises can be checked 
        inside the online textbook and hyperlinks to definitions and other items are included. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My hope is to add other features, like how-to-use-the-software videos, in the future.
        You can view the interactive version for free at
