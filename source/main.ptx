      I am grateful for the sabbatical time Rivier University provided so that I
      could produce this book. The initial design and many of the activities for this textbook
      were created during my Spring 2016 sabbatical, and the book
      was written during my year-long sabbatical in 2023-2024. In addition, 
      I appreciate the 2024 Rivier Summer Faculty Research Grant that enabled
      me to recruit three Rivier University student interns to review the book. The constructive
      feedback I received from these student interns 
      Sarah Frazier, Elisabeth Jacob, and Caitlyn St. Cyr exceeded my expectations. In addition,
      to identifying errors and dead links, they suggested rephrasings of sentences and identified
      where additional explanations, hints, or activities might be helpful. 
      I would also like to thank my MA127 Geometrical Explorations 
      students over the years. Watching their teamwork, struggles, questioning, growth, and 
      success has helped me revise these activities and transform them into a coherent text.  
    </p>    
    <p>
      I thank the PROSE/PreTeXt community who made this format possible. Not only was the code
      available for use, they welcomed me as a new user, encouraged my project, and
      offered technical support. Steven Clontz and Oscar
      Levin were expecially helpful in helping me identify errors in my code, suggesting ways to
      yield desired outcomes, and exploring possible ideas for new structures. 
      They, and other community members, took time out of their own busy schedules and made me feel 
      welcome at their online office hours. I would also like to thank Rob Beezer and the other
      developers for creating and refining the PreTeXt markup language. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My own love of mathematics was sparked by people who encouraged me to explore. My parents,
      Paul and Patricia Deltz, provided a loving home filled with crafts, games, and puzzles. 
      We were encouraged to play, experiment, and learn from our mistakes. Saint Thomas More School
      (Houston) teacher Crystal Mills 
      allowed me to investigate Billiard Ball Geometry after I had demonstrated facility with 
      seventh-grade mathematics. At the University of Dallas, professors Andrew Berner and Charles Coppin
      engaged us in inquiry-based lessons. Their inspiration led me to continue my studies and 
      shaped my own philosophy of teaching. <!--John Faulkner at the University of Virginia advised
      me in my doctoral work. --> 
    </p>
    <!--<p>
      Naturally, this book has been influenced by my previous use of textbooks and my interactions
      with other mathematicians.
    </p>-->

    <p>
      Last but not least, I appreciate the love, support, and encouragement I've received from my family, especially
      my husband John and my son Paul. Paul also helped me as I struggled to use GitHub tools
      for the first time. It was a humbling and rewarding experience to learn from him; an 
      experience I will always treasure.

  <!--Quote from Volker Ecke, Westfield State
  University: <q>I find it very beautiful, interesting and 
  thought-provoking, both in terms of the inquiry pedagogy 
  it embodies and the built-in active learning apps that 
  directly engage students in inquiry.</q>-->

      <p>
        This book is designed to engage students in the art and excitement of doing mathematics:
        of being curious, exploring possibilities, observing patterns, making 
        conjectures, and justifying claims. Active play and discovery has been an 
        important part of my own mathematical journey and continues to be an essential 
        part of the field of mathematics. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        Creative problem solving should not be limited to honors or upper-level 
        courses; given the opportunity all students can grow and thrive through 
        mathematical exploration. Problems can and should be chosen
        to be accessible yet intriguing. I visited kindergarten classes where 
        students were enthusiastic about patterns and numbers, eagerly wanting to 
        share their thoughts and try new things. As a university professor, I wanted 
        to know more about why this enthusiasm and confidence dissipates by the 
        time they reach my classes. For most students, mathematics becomes a set of rules
        to follow, a collection of techniques to master, and a jumble of examples to mimick.
        Despite the fact that some of our most treasured mathematical results took 
        years<mdash>even centuries</mdash> to be established, our society has emphasized speed
        and completion over contemplation. Most students (and adults) spend very little time 
        thinking about problems and instead rely on other resources to provide information and 
        demonstrate methods. They search for examples to mimic instead of creating personal 
        strategies. Without the opportunity to think and explore, there is no excitement and 
        sense of accomplishment. As a teacher and author, my mission is to share the joy of 
        mathematical exploration with students, especially those considering a 
        career in education. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Many resources have mathematical tasks and problems available for students
        to explore. Noncurricular puzzles, games, applications, and fun topics are 
        great ways to encourage teamwork, creativity, and reasoning, but a mathematics 
        course needs to have purpose and cohesion as well. In developing my course, I 
        challenged myself to choose, sequence, and tailor activities so that 
        students would develop and build upon foundational knowledge. As students work   
        on activities in my class, I respond to their questions, celebrate their discoveries, 
        address misconceptions, and probe deeper into interesting ideas. As a class, we 
        discuss the key concepts that arise from the activities.
        As I write this textbook, I find that I need to anticipate how others might use the book 
        and include more detail than I need in my own classroom. Some activities 
        have more scaffolding to ensure that essential material is uncovered and 
        introductory and summary reading has been added to focus and support learning.
        I hope that this additional detail and structure still allows for differing strategies,
        rich discussion, and the thrill of discovery. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Geometry is over 2500 years old, but continues to grow as a field of study. We see 
        geometry, touch geometry, and create with geometry. There is geometry in the physical 
        world around us, the universe beyond us, and in our imagination. Geometry invites us
        not only to explore, but to question, conjecture, and justify. It is a natural place
        to build logic and reasoning. In this textbook, my approach to logic is invitational,
        not rigid. Students are asked to explain their reasoning to a friend, sometimes in 
        writing. They are asked to be clear and thorough, but there is no set format required.
        The goal is not to become mathematical proof writers, but to solidify their own 
        understanding and to share it with others. The ability to write with detail and clarity 
        benefits all students whether they aim to become teachers, lawyers, business professionals, 
        or scientists. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The framework of this book is designed to meet most of our state's cerfication 
        requirements for elementary and early childhood educators, using exploratory 
        activities to lead them to a deeper understanding of 
        the geometry that they will be teaching. Despite the fact that 
        students have been taught most of the formulas and facts before arriving at college, 
        I have found that most students do not fully understand them. Approaching the 
        material from an exploratory perspective with an emphasis on answering the question 
        <sq>why</sq> gives a fresh new look at familiar material. Before redesigning my
        course, I dreaded teaching the topic measurement as it seemed so dry and repetitive. Now
        area of a rectangle forms the foundation upon which much of this book is based. 
        In particular, dissection and construction of polygons are used to observe and 
        justify results like the Pythagorean Theorem. The list of formulas is kept short and
        intuitive, especially with volume and surface area. Instead, students are encouraged
        to use the definitions to compute these quantities. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The textbook includes a mix of interactive activities and 
      open-ended explorations. Many of these are embedded 
      GeoGebra and PolyPad applets, most created by the author.
      Other activities are tactile, using manipulatives, geometrical
      tools, and inexpensive office supplies. Often an option of 
      completing tasks either digitally or tactilely is provided. 
      </p>

      <p>
        My hope is to continue improving the book, releasing a new edition each spring 
        in time for fall adoptions.  These new editions will incorporate additions and 
        corrections suggested by instructors and students who use the text the previous 
        semesters.
        Thus I encourage you to send along any corrections, suggestions, and comments 
        as you have them.

      <title>Exploration activities</title>
      <p>
        Explorations are an essential part of this course. Students, often in groups, make  
        sense of the mathematics and take ownership of the content by discovering relationships 
        through hands-on activities. I am happy to share the classroom worksheets  
        on which this course is based. In fact, I plan to continue to use handouts for 
        most of the inclass explorations even after this textbook is complete. I plan  
        to add many of these to an instructor-accessible  
        website. Instructors wanting to use these sooner should email me!

      <p>
        For those of you reading this in a PDF or in print, I encourage you to also check out 
        the interactive online version, which makes navigating the book a little easier.  
        Additionally, many of the activities are implemented as GeoGebra or Polypad applets, 
        which allow you to work interactively inside the textbook. Some exercises can be checked 
        inside the online textbook and hyperlinks to definitions and other items are included. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My hope is to add other features, like how-to-use-the-software videos, in the future.
