        This chapter provides optional opportunities to explore topics outside the 
        standard curriculum and to observe the connections between geometry, algebra, number, 
        and operations. Observing patterns, making conjectures, and justification is encouraged
        throughout. For prospective teachers, the sections <xref ref="sec-geonumberplay-star"/>
        and <xref ref="sec-geonumberplay-billiards"/> offer an opportunity to review the 
        greatest common factor and least common multiple of integers and to see that these
        concepts play a role outside of operations on fractions. The choice to use GCF instead 
        of GCD was intentional as I wanted to emphasize the term <term>factor</term> here. 
        <aside>
            <p>
                The term <sq>divisor</sq> can be used instead of <sq>factor</sq>, but students 
                seem to translate GCD as <sq>Greatest Common Denominator</sq>.

            In this section, we begin by showing how a star polygon is constructed. For an 
            inclass activity, the instructor may want to provide handouts with the templates
            and colored pencils. Small transparent straight edges can aid students in 
            drawing these designs.  GeoGebra interactives are provided and may be used in lieu 
            of hand sketches. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Five-dot and six-dot star polygons are used to illustrate this process and to 
            introduce the notion of connected components. In graph theory, the term connected 
            component refers to a subset of vertices (points) that one can reach by traveling 
            along edges. In fact, each star polygon is an example of a graph with <m>n</m> 
            vertices and <m>n</m> edges and an instructor could use this section to introduce 
            students to the field of graph theory. Star polygon <m>\{_{3}^{6}\}</m> shows
            that a star "polygon" sometimes ends up simply being an asterisk-like intersection 
            of line segments. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Star polygons drawn on equally spaced dots around a circle 
            will have rotational and reflectional symmetry. If you notice student work lacking 
            symmetry, it is a good idea to help the student focus on skipping the same number and 
            connecting dots. Although some students may want to sketch segments in a different order
            like 1 to <m>k</m>, 2 to <m>k+1</m>, 3 to <m>k+2</m>, etc., they are encouraged to  
            sketch one connected component at a time possibly without lifting their pencil. Drawing 
            each connected component in a different color will make it easier to make and 
            verify conjectures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the students have drawn a few star polygons, they will be invited to predict 
            other star polygon designs based on the number of dots and the skip number. Give  
            the students time to figure these out on their own through experimentation and 
            discussion. I sometimes suggest other <m>n,k</m> pairs that might confirm or 
            contradict their claims as a way of helping them refine and support their
            conjectures.
