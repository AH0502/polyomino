                This activity may be completed using physical tiles or 
                in an app. <commentary component="instructor"> Unfortunately, the only regular polygons included in 
                most sets of pattern blocks only include triangles, quadrilaterals, and 
                hexagons so cardstock stencils may be needed.</commentary> Be sure to save a record of your designs by 
                tracing, photography, or screenshots. Some of the computations  
                will also be used later in this section. You are encourage to 
                keep an accessible record of your work for future reference.

                The web application <url href="https://mathigon.org/polypad#polygons">Polypad
                by Mathigon</url> provides regular <m>n</m>-gons for <m>3\leq n\leq 8</m>. 
                These are the top six shapes in the Polygons and Shapes menu. Simply 
                drag the shape from the left into the whiteboard area. Rotate using the black dot 
                and move by clicking on the interior. For <m>n</m>-gons with <m>n>8</m>, use  
                the hexagon labeled "regular" in the bottom rom of shapes. After you have moved this  
                figure into the whiteboard, use the dotted vertex to increase the number of sides.
                You can then use the duplicated sheet icon on the flip/cut/... menu to make copies 
                of your <m>n</m>-gon.
