    <title>Algebra Principles and Review</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Algebra is an important tool in geometry. We will be using algebra 
            to compute quantities, define formulas, simplify expressions, solve 
            equations, and to justify our claims. This section provides a review of  
            many techniques and principles used in this course as well as some  
            recommendations for making your writing more professional and clearer 
            to your reader.

    <subsection>
        <title>Algebraic Expressions and Equations</title>
        <p>
            Algebraic expressions and equations will be used when we wish to 
            describe and demonstrate geometric facts and formulas involving lengths, areas, and 
            other numerical quantities. The use of variables generalizes the
            statement so that it describes all relevant situations, not just a
            single example. Hence, it is essential that we can simplify expressions  
            and solve equations.

      <statement>
        <p>
          An <term>expression</term> in mathematics is a representation of a 
          numerical quantity consisting of a finite number of variables and/or 
          numbers joined by algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, 
          multiplication, division, and exponentiation. An expression 
          is said to be <term>algebraic</term> if it contains at least one variable.
          We will also use the term <term>numerical expression</term> to describe 
          any representation that is either an algebraic expression or number.
        </p>
      </statement>
      </definition>
      <p>
        Note the difference between an expression and an equation.

        <idx><h>algebraic equation</h></idx>
        <idx><h>equation</h></idx>
        <statement>
            <p>
                An <term>equation</term> is a statement formed by joining two algebraic 
                expressions together with an equal sign. When we solve an equation, we  
                determine which numerical quantities will make the statement true.
            </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
        <p>
            The equals sign is also used when we simplify a statement, joining the  
            equivalent expressions immediately preceding and following the sign. In 
            this situation, a series of equal signs in succession are allowed. You 
            show verify that any expressions joined by this symbol are indeed equal.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="example-simplify">
            <title>Simplifying an Expression</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Simplify the expression <m>(x+y)^2-2xy</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Solving this expression requires an expansion of <m>(x+y)^2</m>
                    before we can subtract <m>2xy</m>. One correct way of writing 
                    this is the following.
                <me>(x+y)^2-2xy=(x+y)(x+y)-2xy=x^2+2xy+y^2-2xy=x^2+y^2.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    One might also write <m>(x+y)^2=(x+y)(x+y)=x^2+2xy+y^2</m> and 
                    then compute <m>(x+y)^2-2xy=x^2+2xy+y^2-2xy=x^2+y^2.</m>
                </p>
            </answer>
        </example>
        <p>
            In <xref ref="example-simplify"/>, one should avoid writing 
            <me>(x+y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2-2xy=x^2+y^2</me> because the two expressions on 
            either side of the first equal sign are not equal, the expression <m>2xy</m>
            has been subtracted in the second expression, but not the first. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When solving an equation, it is bad practice to put equal signs between  
            steps as the quantity frequently changes. Each step of the solving 
            process should be a separate statement with a single equal sign. 
            Simply write each step on a new line 
            or use arrows or words (then, so, since, etc.) to link the statements.

            <answer>
                <p>
                    One acceptable way of writing this for exercises is the 
                    following:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>(x+3)^2-6x\amp =\amp 34</mrow>
                        <mrow>x^2+6x+9-6x\amp =\amp 34</mrow>
                        <mrow>x^2+9\amp =\amp 34</mrow>
                        <mrow>-9\amp \amp -9</mrow>
                        <mrow>x^2\amp=\amp 25</mrow>
                        <mrow> x \amp = \pm 5</mrow>
                    </md>
                    We have found two numbers <m>5</m> and <m>-5</m> that 
                    solve the equation. If this were a problem about geometric  
                    quantities, we frequently rule out negative numbers as unreasonable.
                </p>
            </answer>
        </example>
        <p>
            A frequent error made by students is to write 
            <me>
                (x+3)^2-6x= 34=x^2+6x+9-6x = 34=x^2+9=34=x^2=25= x=\pm 5.
            </me>
            Why is this incorrect? Near the end of the line, we see 
            <m>25=x=\pm 5</m>. This would imply that <m>25=\pm 5</m>, a statement 
            that is clearly false.

                    To solve <me>x^3-5x^2=6x</me>, we first use

                    <m>6x</m> from both sides of the equation so that the

              <p>
                The <term>square</term> of a number <m>x</m> is the number <m>x^2=x\cdot x</m>. Note 
                that the number <m>x</m> may be negative, positive, or 0, but the square,
                <m>x^2</m> is always greater than or equal to 0.
                </p>
                <p>
                The <term>square root</term> of a number <m>x</m> is the nonnegative  
                number <m>r</m> such that <m>r^2=x</m>. We use the notation <m>\sqrt{x}</m>
                to represent the square root of <m>x</m>. 
              </p>

          </definition>
          <p>
        The notation <m>c^2</m> is read <m>c</m>-squared and is equivalent to 
        the product <m>c\times c</m>. Later in this text we will be interested 
        in cubing a number <m>s</m> which we can write as <m>s^3</m> or 
        <m>s\times s\times s</m>. On the set of nonnegative 
        numbers <fn>A number <m>x</m> is said to be <term>nonnegative</term> if 
        <m>x\ge 0</m>. The square root cannot undo the action of squaring a 
        negative number like <m>-3</m> because <m>\sqrt{(-3)^2}=3</m>.</fn>, the 
        square root acts as the inverse (or "undoing") function of the squaring 
        function. Thus, whenever you would like to undo the squaring function 
        in an equation such as in the above example, we will take the square 
        root of both sides. Hence, the equation in the Pythagorean Theorem can 
        be written equivalently as <m>\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}=\sqrt{c^2}</m> or 
        <m>\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}=c</m>. Note the inverse action: <m>\sqrt{c^2}=c</m>. 
        In fact, the squaring function also undoes the square root function: 
        <m>(\sqrt{c})^2=\sqrt{c}\times\sqrt{c}=c</m>. This is what we mean by a 
        pair of inverse functions; applying them one right after the other 
        (in either order) cancels their action. Examples of inverse function 
        pairs that you may be more familiar with include adding 4 and subtracting 
        4 and also dividing by 10 and multiplying by 10. Note how the two 
        functions undo each other and recall how you have used them to solve 
        equations. 
        The cubing function and cube root function are also inverses.
