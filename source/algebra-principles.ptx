    <title>Algebra Principles and Review</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Algebra is an important tool in geometry. We will be using algebra 
            to compute quantities, define formulas, simplify expressions, solve 
            equations, and to justify our claims. This section provides a review of  
            many techniques and principles used in this course as well as some  
            recommendations for making your writing more professional and clearer 
            to your reader.

    <subsection>
        <title>Algebraic Expressions and Equations</title>
        <p>
            Algebraic expressions and equations will be used when we wish to 
            describe and demonstrate geometric facts and formulas involving lengths, areas, and 
            other numerical quantities. The use of variables generalizes the
            statement so that it describes all relevant situations, not just a
            single example. Hence, it is essential that we can simplify expressions  
            and solve equations.

      <statement>
        <p>
          An <term>expression</term> in mathematics is a representation of a 
          numerical quantity consisting of a finite number of variables and/or 
          numbers joined by algebraic operations such as addition, subtraction, 
          multiplication, division, and exponentiation. An expression 
          is said to be <term>algebraic</term> if it contains at least one variable.
          We will also use the term <term>numerical expression</term> to describe 
          any representation that is either an algebraic expression or number.
        </p>

        Note the difference between an expression and an equation.

        <idx><h>equation</h></idx>
        <statement>
            <p>
                An <term>equation</term> is a statement formed by joining two algebraic 
                expressions together with an equal sign. When we solve an equation, we  
                determine which numerical quantities will make the statement true.
            </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
        <p>
            The equals sign is also used when we simplify a statement, joining the  
            equivalent expressions immediately preceding and following the sign. In 
            this situation, a series of equal signs in succession are allowed. You 
            show verify that any expressions joined by this symbol are indeed equal.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="example-simplify">
            <title>Simplifying an Expression</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Simplify the expression <m>(x+y)^2-2xy</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Solving this expression requires an expansion of <m>(x+y)^2</m>
                    before we can subtract <m>2xy</m>. One correct way of writing 
                    this is the following.
                <me>(x+y)^2-2xy=(x+y)(x+y)-2xy=x^2+2xy+y^2-2xy=x^2+y^2.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    One might also write <m>(x+y)^2=(x+y)(x+y)=x^2+2xy+y^2</m> and 
                    then compute <m>(x+y)^2-2xy=x^2+2xy+y^2-2xy=x^2+y^2.</m>
                </p>
            </answer>
        </example>
        <p>
            In <xref ref="example-simplify"/>, one should avoid writing 
            <me>(x+y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2-2xy=x^2+y^2</me> because the two expressions on 
            either side of the first equal sign are not equal, the expression <m>2xy</m>
            has been subtracted in the second expression, but not the first. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When solving an equation, it is bad practice to put equal signs between  
            steps as the quantity frequently changes. Each step of the solving 
            process should be a separate statement with a single equal sign. 
            Simply write each step on a new line 
            or use arrows or words (then, so, since, etc.) to link the statements.

            <answer>
                <p>
                    One acceptable way of writing this for exercises is the 
                    following:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>(x+3)^2-6x\amp =\amp 34</mrow>
                        <mrow>x^2+6x+9-6x\amp =\amp 34</mrow>
                        <mrow>x^2+9\amp =\amp 34</mrow>
                        <mrow>-9\amp \amp -9</mrow>
                        <mrow>x^2\amp=\amp 25</mrow>
                        <mrow> x \amp = \pm 5</mrow>
                    </md>
                    We have found two numbers <m>5</m> and <m>-5</m> that 
                    solve the equation. If this were a problem about geometric  
                    quantities, we frequently rule out negative numbers as unreasonable.
                </p>
            </answer>
        </example>
        <p>
            A frequent error made by students is to write 
            <me>
                (x+3)^2-6x= 34=x^2+6x+9-6x = 34=x^2+9=34=x^2=25= x=\pm 5.
            </me>
            Why is this incorrect? Near the end of the line, we see 
            <m>25=x=\pm 5</m>. This would imply that <m>25=\pm 5</m>, a statement 
            that is clearly false.

                    =\frac{1}{d}(x+y)=\frac{x+y}{d}.
                </me>

    </principle>
    <p>
        The Distributive Law, together with the other field properties, allows 
        us to multiply polynomials.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="examp-mult-poly">
        <title>Multiplying a Polynomial</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
            Multiply <m>(2x+1)(x^2-3x+5)</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <answer><m>2x^3-5x^2+7x+5</m></answer>
        <solution>
            <p>
                First we use the distributive law, multiplying each term in the second 
                factor by <m>2x+1</m>:
                <md>(2x+1)(x^2-3x+5)=(2x+1)(x^2)+(2x+1)(-3x)+(2x+1)(5)</md>. 
                An obtional step, but one that makes the distributive law more evident, is  
                to us the commutative law of multiplication to reverse the order of the factors  
                in each term:
                <md>(2x+1)(x^2)+(2x+1)(-3x)+(2x+1)(5)=x^2(2x+1)+(-3x)(2x+1)+5(2x+1).</md> 
                We can then use the distributive law on each term to get
                <me>
                    <mrow>x^2(2x+1)+(-3x)(2x+1)+5(2x+1)\amp=x^2(2x)+x^2(1)-3x(2x)-3x(1)+5(2x)+5(1)</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp 2x^3+x^2-6x^2-3x+10x+5 </mrow>
                </me>
                Finally, we use the distributive law to combine like terms:
                <me>
                    <mrow>2x^3+x^2-6x^2-3x+10x+5 \amp =2x^3+(1-6)x^2+(10-3)x+5 </mrow>  
                    <mrow> \amp =2x^3-5x^2+7x+5.</mrow>
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the distributive law makes the process work, we typically speed 
                the process up by multiplying each term in the first factor by each 
                term in the second factor:
                <me>
                    <mrow> (2x+1)(x^2-3x+5)\amp =2x(x^2)+2x(-3x)+2x(5)+1(x^2)+1(-3x)+1(5)</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp =2x^3-6x^2+10x+x^2-3x+5</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp =2x^3-5x^2+7x+5.</mrow>
                </me>
            </p>
        </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
        As demonstrated in the solution of <xref ref="examp-mult-poly"/>, the product 
        of two polynomials can be found by multiplying each term in the first polynomial  
        by each term in the second polynomial and then adding these products. If the 
        first polynomial has <m>m</m> terms and the second polynomial has <m>n</m> terms,
        then there will be <m>mn</m> terms before we combine like terms.

                    To solve <me>x^3-5x^2=6x</me>, we first use 
                    <xref ref="principle-addition-equality" text="title"/> to subtract 
                    <m>6x</m> from both sides of the equation so that the
                    right side of the equation is 0. Thus,<me>x^3-5x^2-6x=0</me>. 
                    By <xref ref="principle-distributive" text="title"/>, 
                    <me>x(x-6)(x+1)=(x^2-6x)(x+1)=x^3-6x^2+x^2-6x=x^3-5x^2-6x</me>.

                    <me>x(x-6)(x+1)=0</me>. Therefore, <xref ref="principle-zero-product"

        <title>Functions and Operations</title>
        <p>
            Operations, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, give us a way of  
            combining numbers and expressions. It is worth the time to read the symbols that 
            tell us what operation is being used. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Functions typically involve operations, but they play a different role. 
            A function is a rule that allows us to assign an output for each allowable input.
            In algebra, functions are given by an algebraic expression where we can 
            replace the variable by the input and compute the value of the
            corresponding output. We also use letters, like <m>f</m> or <m>g</m>, to 
            name our function. The symbol <m>f(x)</m> stands for the output when function 
            <m>f</m> is performed on <m>x</m> and the symbol <m>f(5)</m> stands for the output when function 
            <m>f</m> is performed on <m>5</m>. Often the variable <m>y</m> is used to 
            represent the output(s). When graphing functions, we plot the pairs <m>(x,f(x))</m>;
            also denoted <m>(x,y)</m>.

            In <xref ref="example-algrev-sq-sqrt"/>, we observe how the actions of 
            squaring and taking the square root undo each other. The square of <m>5</m>
            is <m>25</m> and the square root of <m>25</m> is <m>5</m>. Similarly,
            the square root of <m>400</m> is <m>20</m> and the square of <m>20</m> is 
            <m>400</m>. Thus, when we perform a square and a square root in succession, 
            the two actions cancel each other out. For this reason, the squaring function 
            and the square root function are said to be <term>inverse operations</term>
            on the set of nonnegative 
            numbers<fn>A number <m>x</m> is said to be <term>nonnegative</term> if 
            <m>x\ge 0</m>.</fn>. Since geometric measurements are nonnegative, we may 
            use the square root function to undo the squaring function and vice versa. 
            Thus, whenever you would like to undo the squaring function 
            in an equation such as in the above example, we will take the square 
            root of both sides.

            Using the <xref ref="thm-Pythagorean">Pythagorean Theorem</xref> to find 
            lengths will require squaring and taking square roots of numbers.
            The equation <m>a^2+b^2=c^2</m>in the Pythagorean Theorem can 
            be written equivalently as <m>\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}=\sqrt{c^2}</m> or 
            <m>\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}=c</m>. Note the use of the inverse action: <m>\sqrt{c^2}=c</m>. 
            In fact, the squaring function also undoes the square root function: 
            <m>(\sqrt{c})^2=\sqrt{c}\times\sqrt{c}=c</m>. This is what we mean by a 
            pair of inverse functions; applying them one right after the other 
            (in either order) cancels their action. On the other hand, we need to be  
            careful in applying an inverse operation. The square root of <m>a^2+b^2</m>
            is not equal to <m>a+b</m> because the square of <m>a+b</m> is not <m>a^2+b^2</m>.
            Instead, the square of <m>a+b</m> is <m>(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2</m> so that 
            <m>\sqrt{a^2+2ab+b^2}=\sqrt{(a+b)^2}=a+b</m>.

            use placement and size of type, like <m>5^{1+3}</m> or <m>5x</m>. 
            </fn>, are used when we want to treat a numerical expression as a single quantity. 
            Thus, we start with the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

            When there are variables in an expression, we may not be able to perform 
            operations in the standard order. Without a specified value, we cannot add 
            a number like <m>5</m> to an expression like <m>x</m>. Instead, we use the 
            distributive law and concept of like terms to simplify our expression.

            As equations become more complex, there is no specific order in which to 
            perform inverse operations. If one or both sides can be simplified, that is  
            often a good first or intermediate step. Undoing operations is typically done  
            in the reverse order, just as we need to unpeel layers of clothing in the evening, 
            each item being removed in the opposite order in which it was put on. Our goal in 
            a linear equation is to get down to a single appearance of the variable and to 
            isolate that variable, as in <m>x=</m>. In polynomial equations, we usually aim to 
            manipulate the expression until all variables and nonzero numbers are on one side of  
            the equation so that we can factor the expression and apply <xref ref="principle-zero-product"
            text="title"/> to find all solutions.

        <example>
            <title>Solving Equations with Order of Operations</title>
            <statement>
                <p> 
                    Solve the equation, <m>5(x-3)+8=58</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    We will demonstrate several methods. To emphasize how  
                    order of operations are reversed when undoing operations, we
                    note that adding 8 would be last in a computation. Thus our first  
                    step is to subtract 8 (or add <m>-8</m>) to both sides of our 
                    equation, resulting in <m>5(x-3)=50</m>. Next we, divide both sides by 
                    <m>5</m>, leaving <m>x-3=10</m>. Finally, we add <m>3</m> to get <m>x=13</m>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that if we start by dividing by 5, <xref ref="principle-distributive"/> 
                    tells us that we must also divide 8 by 5. The resulting equation, <m>x-3+\frac{8}{5}=\frac{58}{5}</m>
                    or <m>x-3+1.6=11.6</m>, is correct but more difficult to solve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we could solve this equation by first simplifying the left side.
                    Our expression <m>5(x-3)+8=5x-15+8=5x-7.</m> Replacing the original left 
                    side by this simplified version gives <m>5x-7=58</m>. Adding <m>7</m> to 
                    both sides gives <m>5x=65</m> and dividing by 5 gives <m>x=13</m>.
                </p>
