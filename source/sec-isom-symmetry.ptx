  <title>Symmetry</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Snowflakes, product logos, rose windows, and mandalas: these are just a few examples of 
      symmetry in our world. While the applications to art and architecture may 
      be most obvious, scientists observe symmetry as they study the structure 
      and behavior of chemicals, bacterium, plants, and animals.

    <title>Two Types of Symmetry</title>
    <p>
      Finite two-dimensional designs, such as snowflakes and logos, may have 
      reflectional symmetry and/or rotational symmetry. <xref ref="fig-rosette1"/>
      displays a design with both reflectional and rotational symmetry.

        <p>
          A design is said to have <term>reflectional symmetry</term> if there is 
          a line such that reflecting the design across that line causes the design 
          to align perfectly with itself. This line is called a <term>line of symmetry
          </term> for the design. Each point on one side of the line of symmetry reflects 
          to a corresponding image point on the other side of the line and the image of 
          a point reflects back across the line to the original point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflectional symmetry is also called <term>mirror symmetry</term> and a 
          line of symmetry may be called a <term>mirror</term>. It is possible for a 
          design with mirror symmetry to have multiple lines of symmetry.

        A design is said to have <term>rotational symmetry</term> if there is a

        maps the design onto itself. The image of the design will look identical to the original

        In calculating the order of symmetry, we count a full 360-degree turn, but not a 0-degree

    <title>Exploring Symmetry of Polygons</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this section, we will focus on the symmetry of polygons and observe
        why regular polygons have greater symmetry than nonregular ones. Once 
        again, we look for consistant patterns that might generalize. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We begin our exploration with triangles: As you complete the activities
        in <xref ref="explor-symm-triangletype"/>, consider the following questions:
        What types of symmetry do triangles have? How does the shape of a
        triangle affect its symmetry?

        <p>
          <xref ref="explor-symm-triangletype"/> and 
          <xref ref="explor-symm-regpoly"/> may be completed using the provided
          GeoGebra applets or on paper. Note that folding is an effective tool 
          for constructing and verifying lines of symmetry. A protractor and 
          straight edge are also helpful in performing these task.

      Perhaps you noticed that the symmetry of a triangle depends on the number of 
      congruent sides it has. Since reflections and rotations preserve 
      angle measure and length, each side and angle must map to a congruent
      object of the same type. Thus, an equilateral triangle has both 
      rotational and mirror symmetry, an isosceles triangle has only mirror 
      symmetry, and a scalene triangle has neither type of symmetry. In the 
      next exploration, we look at the symmetry of regular <m>n</m>-gons.

        In <xref ref="sec-isom-composing-reflections"/>, we saw that when we 
        performed a sequence of reflections in succession, the composition was 
        the same as a single isometry, either another reflection, a 
        translation, a rotation, or a glide reflection. The type of isometry 
        depended on the number of reflections and whether the reflecting 
        lines were parallel. With a finite design such as the one in 
        <xref ref="fig-rosette1"/>, note that any lines of symmetry must 
        intersect and their point of intersection will be in the center of the 
        figure. If the figure also has rotational symmetry, then the center of the 
        rotation will be at this central point.

          Explain why a translation and a glide reflection cannot be symmetry 
          transformation of finite designs or polygons. Do you think translations 
          and/or glide reflections could be symmetry transformations of infinite 
          tilings or infinite wallpaper borders? Explain in words and/or pictures.

            <introduction>
              <p>
                As we record the result of performing symmetries on the triangle 
                in <xref ref="GGappfortrisymm"/>, we will use the notation <m>r_0</m>, <m>r_{120}</m>,
                <m>r_{240}</m> to represent counterclockwise rotations of 
                0 degrees, 120 degrees, and 240 degrees about the center 
                of the triangle.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will also use the notation <m>m_n</m>, <m>m_p</m>, 
                and <m>m_v</m> to denote the reflections across line <m>n</m>
                with negative slope, line <m>p</m> with positive slope, and
                the vertical line <m>v</m>, respectively.
              </p>
              <aside>
                <p>
                  One hint to recognizing the difference is that the plural 
                  form, <term>symmetries</term>, will usually refer to 
                  symmetry transformations. When discussing the property of 
                  symmetry, the author will use the singular form.

                Because these are symmetries, the actions will always result in 
                the same equilateral triangle. What changes is the locations of 
                vertices <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>.
                Note that the image of the triangle after performing <m>r_0</m> 
                is the same as <xref ref="fig-image-eqtrisymmgp"/>. We call this 
                the Home Position. When using the GeoGebra applet 
                <xref ref="GGappfortrisymm"/>, we can click on the icon in the 
                upper right that looks like a circle with clockwise-oriented 
                arrows to return to the Home Position.

            <p>
              Like the multiplication table above, we can create a table for the 
              composition of symmetry isomorphisms on an equilateral triangle using the
              following steps as a guide. Each entry you add to <xref ref="composition-table"/> 
              will always be one of the six symmetries of the triangle; namely,
              <m>r_0</m>, <m>r_{120}</m>, <m>r_{240}</m>, <m>m_n</m>, <m>m_p</m>, or 
              <m>m_v</m>. When you use <xref ref="GGappfortrisymm"/> to compute compositions,
              be sure to reset the triangle to home position before performing the first of 
              the two actions and then perform the second action without resetting the 
              triangle. Compare the final result to the vertex labels you recorded in 
              <xref ref="record-trisymm-images"/> and then use the symbol,
              <m>r_0</m>, <m>r_{120}</m>, <m>r_{240}</m>, <m>m_n</m>, <m>m_p</m>, or 
              <m>m_v</m> that corresponds to the output of the composition.

                      Each reflection, like <m>m_n</m>, undoes itself. The 
                      number <m>-1</m> behaves similarly in multiplication.
                      The identities, <m>r_0</m> in this symmetry group and
                      <m>1</m> in the real numbers, also have this property.

                      Algebra connection: The operation multiplication on the set of real

                      satisfy the commutative property? Support your answer.
