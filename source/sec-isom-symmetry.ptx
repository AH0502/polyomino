  <title>Symmetry</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Snowflakes, product logos, rose windows, mandalas: these are just a few examples of 
      symmetry in our world. While the applications to art and architecture may 
      be most obvious, scientists observe symmetry as they study the structure 
      and behavior of chemicals, plantlife, and reflected objects.

    <title>Two Types of Symmetry</title>
    <p>
      Finite two-dimensional designs, such as snowflakes and logos, may have 
      reflectional symmetry and/or rotational symmetry. <xref ref="fig-rosette1"/>
      displays a design with both reflectional and rotational symmetry.

      <statement>
        <p>
          A design is said to have <term>reflectional symmetry</term> if there is 
          a line such that reflecting the design across that line causes the design 
          to align perfectly with itself. This line is called a <term>line of symmetry
          </term> for the design. Each point on one side of the line of symmetry reflects 
          to a corresponding image point on the other side of the line and the image of 
          a point reflects back across the line to the original point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflectional symmetry is also called <term>mirror symmetry</term> and a 
          line of symmetry may be called a <term>mirror</term>. It is possible for a 
          design with mirror symmetry to have multiple lines of symmetry.

    <title>Check your Understanding</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Draw the four lines of symmetry in <xref ref="fig-rosette1"/>. Verify
        that the design stays the same when reflected across each line.

  </exercise>
  <definition xml:id="def-rotational-symm">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A design is said to have <term>rotational symmetry</term> if there is a 
        rotation about a point with a positive angle of less than 360 degrees that 
        maps the design onto itself. The image of the design will look identical to the original
        even in location and angle. The number of positions that the figure can be 
        rotated to and still look the same is called the <term>order of symmetry</term>. 
        In calculating the order of symmetry, we count the original position (0-degree
        rotation) or a full 360-degree turn, but not both since they are the same
        position. If the order of symmetry of a figure is <m>k</m>, we say that the 
        figure has <term><m>k</m>-fold symmetry.</term>
