  <introduction>
    <p>
      Snowflakes, product logos, rose windows, mandalas: these are just a few examples of 
      symmetry in our world. While the applications to art and architecture may 
      be most obvious, scientists observe symmetry as they study the structure 
      and behavior of chemicals, plantlife, and reflected objects.

    <title>Two Types of Symmetry</title>
    <p>
      Finite two-dimensional designs, such as snowflakes and logos, may have 
      reflectional symmetry and/or rotational symmetry. <xref ref="fig-rosette1"/>
      displays a design with both reflectional and rotational symmetry.

        <p>
          A design is said to have <term>reflectional symmetry</term> if there is 
          a line such that reflecting the design across that line causes the design 
          to align perfectly with itself. This line is called a <term>line of symmetry
          </term> for the design. Each point on one side of the line of symmetry reflects 
          to a corresponding image point on the other side of the line and the image of 
          a point reflects back across the line to the original point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflectional symmetry is also called <term>mirror symmetry</term> and a 
          line of symmetry may be called a <term>mirror</term>. It is possible for a 
          design with mirror symmetry to have multiple lines of symmetry.

        A design is said to have <term>rotational symmetry</term> if there is a 
        rotation about a point with a positive angle of less than 360 degrees that 
        maps the design onto itself. The image of the design will look identical to the original

                  As we record the result of performing symmetries on the triangle 
                  in <xref ref="GGappfortrisymm"/>, we will use the notation <m>r_0</m>, <m>r_{120}</m>,
                  <m>r_{240}</m> to represent counterclockwise rotations of 
                  0 degrees, 120 degrees, and 240 degrees about the center 
                  of the triangle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will also use the notation <m>m_n</m>, <m>m_p</m>, 
                  and <m>m_v</m> to denote the reflections across line <m>n</m>
                  with negative slope, line <m>p</m> with positive slope, and
                  the vertical line <m>v</m>, respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because these are symmetries, the actions will always result in 
                  the same equilateral triangle. What changes is the locations of 
                  vertices <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>.
                  Note that the image of the triangle after performing <m>r_0</m> 
                  is the same as <xref ref="fig-image-eqtrisymmgp"/>. We call this 
                  the Home Position. When using the GeoGebra applet 
                  <xref ref="GGappfortrisymm"/>, we can click on the icon in the 
                  upper right that looks like a circle with clockwise-oriented 
                  arrows to return to the Home Position.

              Like the multiplication table above, we can create a table for the 
              composition of symmetry isomorphisms on an equilateral triangle using the
              following steps as a guide. Each entry you add to the table should 
              always be one of the six symmetries of the triangle; namely,
              <m>r_0</m>, <m>r_{120}</m>, <m>r_{240}</m>, <m>m_n</m>, <m>m_p</m>, or 
              <m>m_v</m>. When you use <xref ref="GGappfortrisymm"/> to compute compositions,
              be sure to reset the triangle to home position before performing the first of 
              the two actions and then perform the second action without resetting the 
              triangle. Compare the final result to the vertex labels you recorded in 
              <xref ref="record-trisymm-images"/> and then use the symbol,
              <m>r_0</m>, <m>r_{120}</m>, <m>r_{240}</m>, <m>m_n</m>, <m>m_p</m>, or 
              <m>m_v</m> that corresponds to the output of the composition.

                    perform <m>m_n</m> followed by <m>r_{120}</m>.<fn>This operation

                  <p>
                    Is <m>m_n\circ r_{120}</m> the same as <m>r_{120}\circ m_n</m>? To determine 
                    <m>m_n\circ r_{120}</m>, start at the home position and first perform <m>r_{120}</m> 
                    followed by <m>m_n</m>. Write the symmetry you just found in the cell of the 
                    <m>r_{120}</m>-column and <m>m_n</m>-row. Compare the two results.
                  </p>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    To complete the <m>r_{120}</m>-column, compute the two compositions:
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          <m>r_{120}\circ m_p</m>, by first rotating the triangle in home position 
                          120 degrees counterclockwise and then reflecting the resulting 
                          triangle across line <m>p</m>, and 
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          <m>r_{120}\circ m_v</m>, by first rotating the triangle in home position 
                          120 degrees counterclockwise and then reflecting the resulting 
                          triangle across line <m>v</m>.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    The <m>r_{120}</m>-column should now be completely filled. Each of the 
                    symmetries, <m>r_0</m>, <m>r_{120}</m>, <m>r_{240}</m>, <m>m_n</m>, 
                    <m>m_p</m>, and <m>m_v</m> will appear exactly once in this colunn.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Now complete the <m>r_{240}</m>-column, each time rotating counterclockwise 240 
                    degrees before performing the symmetry corresponding 
                    to the row heading. Be sure to 
                    return to the home position before beginning each two-stage calculation.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Similarly, we will complete the <m>m_n</m>-column by reflecting the home triangle 
                    across the line <m>n</m> before performing the symmetry 
                    corresponding to the row heading. Check again to make sure that no 
                    symmetry appears twice in the same column.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Complete the last two columns where the first transformation is reflection 
                    across the lines <m>p</m> and <m>v</m>, respectively.
                  </p>
