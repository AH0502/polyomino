        <title>Two-Dimensional and Three-Dimensional Objects</title>
        <p>
            Polygons and circles lie in a plane. Figures that lie in a plane and have a 
            height and length are said to be two-dimensional objects. We can measure
            the area of closed two-dimensional figures. When we limit our geometrical study to objects that
            lie in one common plane, we are studying two-dimensional geometry. We often 
            use an <m>xy</m>-coordinate system to represent points on a plane. The 
            <m>x</m>-axis represents one direction (across) while the <m>y</m>-axis
            represents a second direction (up or down). Objects within the plane also
            include lines (one-dimensional objects) and points (zero-dimensional
            objects). In fact, the real number line or <m>x</m>-axis is one of may 
            one-dimenstional lines in the <m>xy-plane</m>.
            When we define parallel and perpendicular lines, we assume that 
            these one-dimensional lines are lying in a common two-dimensional 
            plane.

                    Skew lines only exist in three-dimensional (or higher)
                    geometry. During our brief glance at spherical geometry in 
                    <xref ref="subsec-polygons-parallel-sphere"/>
                    and hyperbolic geometry in 
                    <xref ref="ExtConc-polygons-parallel-Coxeterdisc"/>,
                    we limited our work to objects on a specified surface. Each 
                    of these surfaces, the sphere or the disk, is analogous to 
                    a plane and hence considered two-dimensional in its non-Euclidean
                    geometry.

                    One can study the sphere as a three-dimensional object in 
                    Euclidean geometry. In addition, one can extend the Hyperbolic 
                    Disk Model to three dimensions.

            In this section, we will explore three-dimensional solids. Solids with 
            flat polygonal sides, like cubes and pyramids, are called polyhedra.
            Other solids, like cylinders and spheres have curved faces.

            To fully understand this chapter, you will need to construct some of 
            these figures. Be prepared to print copies of patterns on paper or cardstock 
            so that you can fold and tape the figures together as needed.

                A <term>polyhedron (plural: polyhedra)</term> is a 
                three-dimensional closed figure in which all of the faces are polygons.
                Both of the solids in <xref ref="fig-convex-concave-polyhedra"/> are 
                polyhedra, but the one on the left is said to be <term>concave</term> since 
                we can connect some vertices, like the far left and top vertex with straight 
                segments that pass through the exterior (outside the surface) of the solid. 
                As we work through this chapter, we will assume that a polyhedron is convex so  
                that it has no valleys or depressions. Any line segment connecting two points 
                on the surface of a convex polyhedron will only contain points on the surface or 
                interior of the polyhedron.

                A <term>face</term> of a geometrical solid refers to a flat surface 
                that forms part of the boundary of the solid. The line segments where two 
                faces meet are called <term>edges</term>, and the points where  
                edges meet are called the <term>vertices</term> of the polyhedron. The  
                vertices of the polyhedron are also vertices of its polygonal faces. 
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
        While it is not incorrect to call a face of a polyhedron a <sq>side</sq>,
        one should be careful to distinguish between a face of the polyhedron and 
        a side of a polygon (which is an edge of the polyhedron). Using the terms
        <term>face</term> and <term>edge</term> will make our discussions about polyhedra 
        clearer.

            <p>
                Note also that a polyhedron has more than one type of angle. 
                In this section, we will be working with angles whose rays are 
                adjacent edges of the polyhedron. Each of these angles is a vertex 
                angle of one of the faces of the polyhedron; hence, we may refer to them 
                as <term>face angles</term>.<fn>This is <em>not</em> the same as a

        <title>Defining Regular Polyhedra</title>
        <p>
            Just as with polygons and tilings, we describe some 
            polyhedra as <term>regular polyhedra</term>. These special 
            solids were identified by Greek mathematicians around 300 B.C.,
            appear in ancient and modern artwork,  
            and are used to model chemical and biological structures today. 
            In this section, we will find that there are only a handful 
            of polyhedra that meet the criteria of being regular.

                                                If you are making your own squares, you will need to 
                                                ensure that every angle of each square is 90 degrees. 
                                                Models made from straws may lose that property without 
                                                proper support. On the other hand, you may have examples 
                                                of a regular polyhedron with square faces already so that
                                                you do not need to build this.

            gives a triangle that can be cut out and folded along the interior lines

            together. This pattern is called a net for the polyhedron.

                        The t-shaped cube net can be folded by first making the center square the base. The next step is to fold up the 
                        four squares around it to create the walls. Finally, fold the remaining square over the top to close the cube.

                        A valid net for a regular polyhedron must fold into a completely closed 3D shape without any overlaps or 
                        gaps. Pay close attention to how individual faces are connected and whether edges meet when folded.

                        These four patterns cannot be a net for a regular polygon. See "Solution" below to read a detailed
                        explanation as to why these patterns do not fit the criteria.

                        None of these patterns can fold into a regular, closed 3D polyhedron. Below are reasons why each of
                        these nets are invalid:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pattern a: Consists of six squares, but when folded some of the squares overlap. Therefore, a cube is 
                        not formed and this net is invalid.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pattern b: Combines both squares and triangles, which do not fit together to form regular polygon.
                        This net is impossible to fold into a 3D shape and is therefore invalid.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pattern c: A regular octahedron requires eight faces, however this net only has six. Does not
                        fold into regular polyhedron and leaves gaps. Therefore, this net is invalid. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pattern d: Also consists of overlapping when folded and therefore is an invalid net.

                            An octahedron has eight faces. It also has six vertices. Each face is a triangle with 
                            three vertices. Counting all face vertices individually gives <m>3 \cdot 8 = 24</m>. These 24 
                            vertex-corners are shared among the six actual vertices. Dividing 24 by six results in four. Therefore, 
                            four triangles meet at each vertex.
