                A <term>polyhedron (plural: polyhedra)</term> is a 
                three-dimensional closed figure in which all of the faces are polygons. 
                Unless stated otherwise, we will assume that a polyhedron is convex so  
                that it has no spikes, or dimples. Any line segment connecting two points 
                on the surface of a convex polyhedron will only contain points on the surface or 
                interior of the polyhedron.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, a <term>face</term> of a geometrical solid refers to a flat surface 
                that forms part of the boundary of the solid. The line segments where two 
                faces meet are called <term>edges</term>, and the <sq>corners</sq> where  
                edges meet are called the <term>vertices</term> of the polyhedron. The  
                vertices of the polyhedron are also vertices of its polygonal faces. <!--Unless  
                specified otherwise, we will be measuring the angles formed by a pair of edges  
                which is the same as measuring the angle of a vertex of a polygonal face.-->
            </p>
            <p>
                While it is not incorrect to call a face of a polyhedron a <sq>side</sq>,
                one should be careful to distinguish between a face of the polyhedron and 
                a side of a polygon (which is an edge of the polyhedron). Using the terms
                <term>face</term> and <term>edge</term> will make our discussions about polyhedron 
                clearer.

                A cube and triangular prism are polyhedra. 
                A cylinder and sphere are not polyhedra since they 
                have curved surfaces.

        <title>Defining Regular Polyhedra</title>
        <p>
            Just as with polygons and tilings, we describe some 
            polyhedra as <term>regular polyhedra</term>. These special 
            solids were identified by Greek mathematicians around 300 B.C.,
            appear in ancient art work,  
            and are used to model chemical and biological structures today. 
            In this section, we will find that only there are only a handful 
            of polyhedra that meet the criteria of being regular.

                                At every vertex, the number of polygons meeting 
                                is the same.

                <p>
                    For this task, you will need copies of rigid congruent equilateral 
                    triangles that can be put together. There are commercially 
                    available shapes that can be snapped together, but you can also 
                    create your own using tagboard or even straws and string.

                            An online search for <sq>isometric graph paper</sq> will give you 
                            a sheet of congruent triangles that could be enlarged, printed on 
                            stiff paper, and cut. Equilateral triangles for building polyhedra 
                            may also be created from short straws and string. Perhaps, you have 
                            other ideas? Popsicle sticks? An edge length of at least 2 centimeters 
                            is recommended.

                    Which regular polyhedra can be formed using equilateral triangles? To answer this  
                    question, we will consider the possible number of triangles that could meet at each 
                    vertex and attempt to construct the polyhedron, making sure that we keep the vertex   
                    arrangement consistent. A summary chart <xref ref="table-regpolyhedra-triangles"/> is 
                    provided at the end of this task to organize your discoveries.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    There is a polyhedron that can be constructed using a total 
                    of six equilateral triangles. Build it and then explain why it 
                    does not satisfy the definition of a regular polyhedron.

                    We now explore whether we can form regular polyhedra using squares, 
                    regular pentagons, or other regular polygons.

                                Regular polyhedra with square faces:

                                    <li>

                                            Each angle of a square has what degree measure?

                                            Is it possible to create a regular polyhedron using 
                                            only squares? If so, determine the number of squares that 
                                            must meet at each vertex and then construct the polyhedron. 
                                            Carefully describe this polyhedron and/or save a picture.

                                                If you are making your own squares, you will need to 
                                                ensure that every angle of each square is 90 degrees. 
                                                Models made from straws may lose that property without 
                                                proper support. On the other hand, you may have examples 
                                                of a regular polyhedron with square faces already so that
                                                you do not need to build this.

        We have determined that there are exactly five regular polyhedra. They have been  
        given the names, <term>tetrahedron</term> (four-faced), <term>hexahedron</term> 
        (six-faced), <term>octahedron</term> (eight-faced), <term>dodecahedron</term> 
        (12-faced), and <term>icosahedron</term> (20-faced). Match these names to the polyhedra 
        you created and add these labels to the appropriate lines in your tables.

                        Give a definition of regular polyhedra in your own words.
                        Then, name and describe each of the five regular polyhedra.
                        In particular, you should mention the shape of each face and 
                        the number of faces meeting at each vertex.

                    Counting Vertices and Edges
                </title>

                    <p>
                        It is easy to lose track when counting the vertices or 
                        edges of a polyhedron with many faces. We can use mathematical 
                        reasoning to compute these values for regular polyhedra.

                                <p>
                                    Knowing that an octahedron consists of eight 
                                    triangular faces, we can count <m>8\times 3=24</m>
                                    vertices and <m>8\times 3=24</m> edges before octahedron 
                                    is assembled. 
                                    <ol>

                                                Every edge gets glued to one edge of another triangle so 
                                                the assembled octahedron will have half as many edges. How 
                                                many edges does the octahedron have?

                                                How many triangles meet at each vertex of an octahedron?
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                Divide the total number, 24, of vertices of the triangles by 
                                                the number of triangles that meet at each vertex of the octahedron.
                                                This will give you the number of vertices in the assembled octahedron.
