        <p>
            In this section we will explore three-dimensional solids. Solids with 
            flat polygonal sides, like cubes and pyramids, are called polyhedra.

                    A <term>polyhedron (plural: polyhedra)</term> is a 
                    three-dimensional closed figure in which all of the faces are polygons.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, a <term>face</term> of a geometrical solid refers to a flat surface 
                    that forms part of the boundary of the solid. The line segments where two 
                    faces meet are called <term>edges</term>, and the <sq>corners</sq> where  
                    edges meet are called the <term>vertices</term> of the polyhedron. The  
                    vertices of the polyhedron are also vertices of polygonal faces. Unless  
                    specified otherwise, we will be measuring the angles formed by a pair of edges  
                    which is the same as measuring the angle of a vertex of a polygonal face.

            We begin by defining and exploring regular polyhedra. These solids appear in ancient art 
            work and are used to model chemical and biological structures today. We will find that only 
            a few exist.

                    A cylinder and sphere have curved surfaces.

                    Explain why a square pyramid is not a regular

                            In <xref ref="sec-polygons-regular"/>, 
                            we found the sum of the measures of the 
                            angles surrounding a vertex was always the same. What was that number?

                        <li>
                            Why must the total degree of the angles surrounding a vertex be 
                            less than that amount if 
                            we are building a polyhedron?

                    Look at some polyhedra or attempt to build some. 
                    Unless it has curved walls, your classroom is probably a polyhedra.

                <p>
                    For this task, you will need plastic or tagboard copies of congruent equilateral 
                    triangles that can be put together. An online search for 
                    <sq>isometric graph paper<sq> will give you a sheet of congruent triangles that could 
                    be enlarged, printed on stiff paper, and cut. Equilateral triangles for building polyhedra may also be created 
                    from straws and string. Side length of at least two inches is recommended.

                    Which regular polyhedra can be formed using equilateral triangles? To answer this  
                    question, we will consider the possible number of triangles that could meet at each 
                    vertex and attempt to construct the polyhedron, making sure that we keep the vertex   
                    arrangement consistent. A summary chart is provided at the end of this task to 
                    organize your discoveries.

                                What happens when you try to construct a polyhedron with only two triangles meeting at 
                                a vertex?

                                It is possible to create a polyhedron with exactly three triangles  
                                meeting at every vertex.
