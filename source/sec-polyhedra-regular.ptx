            <p>
                A <term>polyhedron (plural: polyhedra)</term> is a 
                three-dimensional closed figure in which all of the faces are polygons.
                Both of the solids in <xref ref="fig-convex-concave-polyhedra"/> are 
                polyhedra, but the one on the left is said to be <term>concave</term> since 
                we can connect some vertices, like the far left and top vertex with straight 
                segments that pass through the exterior (outside the surface) of the solid. 
                As we work through this chapter, we will assume that a polyhedron is convex so  
                that it has no valleys or depressions. Any line segment connecting two points 
                on the surface of a convex polyhedron will only contain points on the surface or 
                interior of the polyhedron.

                A <term>face</term> of a geometrical solid refers to a flat surface 
                that forms part of the boundary of the solid. The line segments where two 
                faces meet are called <term>edges</term>, and the points where  
                edges meet are called the <term>vertices</term> of the polyhedron. The  
                vertices of the polyhedron are also vertices of its polygonal faces. 
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
        While it is not incorrect to call a face of a polyhedron a <sq>side</sq>,
        one should be careful to distinguish between a face of the polyhedron and 
        a side of a polygon (which is an edge of the polyhedron). Using the terms
        <term>face</term> and <term>edge</term> will make our discussions about polyhedra 
        clearer.

                Note also that a polyhedron has more than one type of angle. 
                In this section, we will be working with angles whose rays are 
                adjacent edges of the polyhedron. Each of these angles is a vertex 
                angle of one of the faces of the polyhedron; hence, we may refer to them 
                as <term>face angles</term>.<fn>This is <em>not</em> the same as a 
                <term>dihedral angle</term>, measuring the space between two faces.

                A cube and triangular prism are polyhedra. 
                A cylinder and sphere are not polyhedra since they 
                have curved surfaces.

        <title>Defining Regular Polyhedra</title>
        <p>
            Just as with polygons and tilings, we describe some 
            polyhedra as <term>regular polyhedra</term>. These special 
            solids were identified by Greek mathematicians around 300 B.C.,
            appear in ancient and modern art work,  
            and are used to model chemical and biological structures today. 
            In this section, we will find that only there are only a handful 
            of polyhedra that meet the criteria of being regular.

                    A polyhedron is said to be <term>regular</term>

                                At every vertex, the number of polygons meeting 
                                is the same.

                    For this task, you will need copies of rigid congruent equilateral 
                    triangles that can be put together. There are commercially 
                    available shapes that can be snapped together, but you can also 
                    create your own using tagboard or even straws and string.

                            a sheet of congruent triangles that could be enlarged, printed on 
                            stiff paper, and cut. Equilateral triangles for building polyhedra 
                            may also be created from short straws and string. Perhaps, you have 
                            other ideas? Popsicle sticks? An edge length of at least 2 centimeters 
                            is recommended.

                    Which regular polyhedra can be formed using <em>only</em> equilateral triangles? To answer this  
                    question, we will consider the possible number of triangles that could meet at each 
                    vertex and attempt to construct the polyhedron, making sure that we keep the vertex   
                    arrangement consistent. Later you will be asked to enter the 
                    answers to some of these questions into <xref ref="table-regpolyhedra-triangles"/>.

                    We now explore whether we can form regular polyhedra using squares, 
                    regular pentagons, or other regular polygons.

                                            Is it possible to create a regular polyhedron using 
                                            only squares? If so, determine the number of squares that 
                                            must meet at each vertex. Then construct or describe the polyhedron.

                                                If you are making your own squares, you will need to 
                                                ensure that every angle of each square is 90 degrees. 
                                                Models made from straws may lose that property without 
                                                proper support. On the other hand, you may have examples 
                                                of a regular polyhedron with square faces already so that
                                                you do not need to build this.

        We have determined that there are exactly five regular polyhedra. They have  
        the names, <term>tetrahedron</term> (four-faced), <term>hexahedron</term> 
        (six-faced), <term>octahedron</term> (eight-faced), <term>dodecahedron</term> 
        (12-faced), and <term>icosahedron</term> (20-faced). Match these names to the polyhedra 
        you created and add these labels to the appropriate lines in your tables.

            While building your polyhedra, you may have wondered whether it was 
            necessary to cut out and glue each polygon separately. <xref ref="fig-tetranet"/>
            gives a triangle that can be cut out and folded along the interior lines 
            to produce a regular tetrahedron. You may want to leave a little extra paper
            along some of the external edges so that you have a surface for gluing them 
            together. This pattern is called a net for the polyhedron.

                    cutting the polyhedron along some of its edges and unfolding. 
                    There are multiple nets for each polyhedron.

                        It is easy to lose track when counting the vertices or 
                        edges of a polyhedron with many faces. We can use mathematical 
                        reasoning to compute these values for regular polyhedra.

                                    Knowing that an octahedron consists of eight 
                                    triangular faces, we can count <m>8\times 3=24</m>
                                    vertices and <m>8\times 3=24</m> edges before octahedron 
                                    is assembled.

                                                Every edge gets glued to one edge of another triangle so

                                                Divide the total number, 24, of vertices of the triangles by 
                                                the number of triangles that meet at each vertex of the octahedron.
                                                This will give you the number of vertices in the assembled octahedron.
