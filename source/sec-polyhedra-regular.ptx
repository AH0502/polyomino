            In this section we will explore three-dimensional solids. Solids with 
            flat polygonal sides, like cubes and pyramids, are called polyhedra.

                    A <term>polyhedron (plural: polyhedra)</term> is a 
                    three-dimensional closed figure in which all of the faces are polygons.

            We begin by defining and exploring regular polyhedra.

                    A polyhedron is said to be <term>regular</term>
                    if it satisfies these two conditions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Every face is the same regular polygon and
                            </p>

                        <li>

                                At every vertex, the number of polygons 
                                is the same.

                <p>
                    A cube and triangular prism are polyhedra. 
                    A cylinder and sphere have curved surfaces.

                    polyhedron.

                    In <xref ref="sec-polygons-regular"/>, 
                    we found the sum of the measures of the 
                    angles at a vertex was always the same. What was that number?

                <li>
                    Why must the total degree of the angles surrounding a vertex be less than that amount if 
                    we are building a polyhedron?

            Look at some polyhedra or attempt to build some. Your classroom is a polyhedra.
