        <title>Defining Regular Polyhedra</title>
        <p>
            In this section, we define the term <term>regular polyhedron</term> and 
            identify all of the regular polyhedra that can be created. These special 
            solids appear in ancient art 
            work, were delineated by Greek mathematicians around 300 B.C., 
            and are used to model chemical and biological structures today. 
            We will find that only there are only a handful of regular polyhedra.

                    A polyhedron is said to be <term>regular</term>
                    if it satisfies these two conditions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Every face is the same regular polygon and

                                At every vertex, the number of polygons 
                                is the same.

                            In <xref ref="sec-polygons-regular"/>, 
                            we found the sum of the measures of the 
                            angles surrounding a vertex was always the same. 
                            What was that sum?

                            Why must the total degree of the angles surrounding a vertex be

                            we are building a polyhedron?

                    Look at some polyhedra or attempt to build some. 
                    Unless it has curved walls, your classroom is probably a polyhedra.

                    For this task, you will need plastic or tagboard copies of congruent equilateral 
                    triangles that can be put together. An online search for 
                    <sq>isometric graph paper</sq> will give you a sheet of congruent triangles that could 
                    be enlarged, printed on stiff paper, and cut. Equilateral triangles for building polyhedra may also be created 
                    from straws and string. Side length of at least two inches is recommended.

                    Which regular polyhedra can be formed using equilateral triangles? To answer this  
                    question, we will consider the possible number of triangles that could meet at each 
                    vertex and attempt to construct the polyhedron, making sure that we keep the vertex   
                    arrangement consistent. A summary chart <xref ref="table-regpolyhedra-triangles"/> is 
                    provided at the end of this task to organize your discoveries.
