  <title>The Pythagorean Theorem and the Golden Triangle</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we will see how similar right triangles can be used to  
      derive yet another proof of the Pythagorean Theorem. We also will learn 
      about self-similarity and the Golden Triangle. First, we review the key 
      concepts of dilations and similarity already explored in this chapter.

  <p>
    The right triangle in <xref ref="explor-similar-Pyth"/> has the property 
    that the altitude drawn from the right angle to the hypotenuse splits the 
    triangle into two smaller triangles. Both of these triangles are similar to the 
    original triangle. This property is true for all right triangles since the 
    measure of the two acute angles did not matter. In particular, each new triangle 
    has a right angle and one of the original angles. Since the sum of the angles in 
    any triangle is 180 degrees, the newly created angle has the same measure 
    as the remaining angle of the original triangle.

    Will this happen with other triangles? We explore this question in the next

  <conclusion>
    <p>
      The isosceles triangle <m>\Delta ABC</m> explored in <xref ref="explor-golden-triangle"/> 
      is known as a Golden Triangle. When we create a smaller, but similar, triangle
      by bisecting a base angle, the constant of proportionality equals the ratio 
      of the long side to the short side (base) of the original triangle. We can
      repeat this process of bisecting the base angle of our new triangle to form
      even smaller similar triangles indefinitely. At every stage of the process,
      the ratio of the long side to the base will remain 
      <m>\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx 1.618033989</m> and equal to the constant of 
      proportionality for the pair of similar triangles. This number is known as the 
      Golden Ratio and is an irrational number <fn>An irrational number cannot be 
      written as the ratio of integers. The decimal expansion of an irrational number 
      is infinite and does not become an infinitely repeating block of digits.
      </fn>.
      </p>
      <!--To map ABC onto ABD, we first dilate <m>\Delta ABC</m> with center <m>B</m>
      and scale factor <m>\frac{1}{\phi}=0.5(\sqrt{5}-1)</m>. We the reflect this 
      image across the bisector of <m>\angle{ABC}</m>.-->

        <solution>
          <p>
            Triangles <m>\Delta EFC</m> and <m>\Delta BDE</m> are similar to triangle <m>\Delta BAC</m>. This means their
            corresponding angles are equal. Since <m>m\angle BAC=108</m> degrees, both <m>m\angle EFC</m> and <m>m\angle BDE</m>
            are also 108 degrees.

          <p>
            When D, E, and F are midpoints on the sides of <m>\Delta ABC</m>, the smaller triangles like <m>\Delta DEF</m>
            and <m>\Delta ADF</m> are similar to <m>\Delta ABC</m>. This means their corresponding angles are equal. So
            <m>\angle FDE</m> and <m>\angle AFD</m> both correspond to <m>m\angle C</m>. Since <m>m\angle C</m> is 30 degrees,
            both <m>m\angle FDE</m> and <m>m\angle AFD</m> are also 30 degrees.

          <p>
            It is given that <m>m\angle FDE=30</m> degrees and <m>m\angle DEF=108</m> degrees. Using the Triangle Angle
            Sum Theorem, <m>m\angle EFD</m> is calculated as: 180 - (108 + 30) = 42 degrees.

        <hint>
          <p>
            Imagine <m>\Delta ABC</m> as the big triangle. If lines are drawn inside it that are parallel to its sides, 
            smaller triangles are made. These smaller triangles will have the same angles as the big one, <m>\Delta ABC</m>.

        <answer>
          <p>
            The four smaller triangles that are similar to <m>\Delta ABC</m> include: <m>\Delta EFD</m>, <m>\Delta ADF</m>, 
            <m>\Delta DBE</m>, and <m>\Delta FEC</m>.
          </p> 
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Drawing lines parallel to the sides of triangle <m>\Delta ABC</m> creates smaller triangles. Parallel lines
            ensure two matching angles. Since all angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees (Triangle Angle Sum Theorem), the third angle
            must also match. Thus, the smaller triangles are similar to triangle <m>\Delta ABC</m>.

        <solution>
          <p>
            Point F is the midpoint of side <m>\overline{AC}</m>, meaning it divides the side exactly in half. Since the total
            length of <m>\overline{AC}</m> is 10, the length of <m>\overline{AF}</m> is half of that. Therefore, the length of
            <m>\overline{AF}</m> is 5.

        <hint>
          <p>
            Line segment <m>\overline{DF}</m> connects points D and F. Since both are midpoints, the Midsegment Theorem applies.
            This theorem helps find the length of a line segment that connects two midpoints of a triangle.

            The length of <m>\overline{DF}</m> is 7.
          </p>
        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            When D and F are the midpoints of sides <m>\overline{AB}</m> and <m>\overline{AC}</m>, they create a midsegment
            called <m>\overline{DF}</m>. The Midsegment Theorem states that this segment is always half the length of the
            triangle's third side, <m>\overline{BC}</m>. Since <m>\overline{BC}</m> measures 14, <m>\overline{DF}</m> is
            exactly half of that, making it 7.

            For the center of this dilation, find the vertex that is shared by both <m>\Delta ABC</m> and <m>\Delta FEC</m>.
            For scale factor, consider how the sides of <m>\Delta FEC</m> are smaller because F and E are midpoints.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Point C is the center of dilation because it is the shared corner between <m>\Delta ABC</m> and <m>\Delta FEC</m>.
            The scale factor is <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>. This is because the new triangle <m>\Delta FEC</m> has sides such as
