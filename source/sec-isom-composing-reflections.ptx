        As we prepare to build on our knowledge of isometries, it is wise to summarize what we know so far. 
        We know that a transformation of a plane is a mapping or function that sends each point <m>P</m> on the
        plane to a unique point <m>P'</m> called its image under the transformation. Some transformations are 
        collineations, meaning that if a set of 
        points all lie on the same line, then their images will also lie on a single line. 
        We have observed that some collineations preserve shape and angle measure and that some collineations 
        that preserve angle measure will also preserve distance. The transformations that preserve all of these, 
        collinearity, angle measure, and distance, are called <term>isometries</term>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We are now familiar with three types of isometries: reflections, translations, and rotations. Are 
        there other types of isometries? Are there transformations that are not isometries? Given a picture 
        of two congruent figures, is there always an isometry mapping one to the other? If so, how do we 
        determine what type of isometry it is? 
    </p>
    <p>
        For this last question, we look at some of the properties that distinguish the types of isometries. 
        If the orientation is reversed, the isometry may be a reflection. On the other hand, if the
        orientation is preserved, the isometry will not be a reflection, but may be a translation or a 
        rotation.

            <li>
              <p>
                How might you tell the difference between a translation and a rotation? Assume that you are 
                given a picture of two congruent triangles <m>\Delta ABC</m> and <m>\Delta A'B'C'</m> where the
                orientation is the same. How do you know whether a translation takes <m>\Delta ABC</m> to 
                <m>\Delta A'B'C'</m>? How do you know whether the isometry is a rotation? Could it be both? or 
                neither?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Imagine that <m>\Delta ABC</m> is a moveable cutout triangle with a pretty blue pattern on 
                the front face and gray cardboard on the back. We can think of the action of an isometry 
                as moving <m>\Delta ABC</m> so that it aligns perfectly with its image <m>\Delta A'B'C'</m>.   
                Which isometries studied so far will keep <m>\Delta ABC</m> blue side up? Which will turn 
                <m>\Delta ABC</m> over so that it is cardboard side up? What property is this related to?

        Is the composition of two isometries always an isometry?  What type?  
        The chart will be useful in answering these questions!  Fill it out to the best of your ability 
        now even if youâ€™re not 100% certain of your answers.  You will have a chance to revise and add to this 
        chart later.

    A defining object is an object that is essential in determining where every point on the 
    plane gets mapped in an isometry.  It does not depend on any one point being mapped but is universal to 
    the entire mapping.  
    Examples include a reflecting line, center, vector, angle measure.
    An isometry has the same orientation if points that were in clockwise order produce images in the same 
    clockwise order.  Every object moved by a same-orientation isometry could be moved into position without 
    being turned over.  If an isometry does not maintain the same orientation, that is, if points originally 
    in clockwise order get moved into counterclockwise order, we say the isometry has reverse orientation.
