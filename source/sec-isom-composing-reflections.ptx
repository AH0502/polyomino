  <title>Compositions of Reflections</title>
<subsection>
    <title>Compositions</title>
    <p>
      Each of the transformations we have studied so far, reflections, translations, and rotations, 
      perform an action on the points of the plane. In fact, a transformation is a <term>function</term>
      where the inputs are geometric objects instead of numbers. In algebra, you learned about the 
      <q>add three</q> function, <m>f(x)=x+3</m>, and the <q>multiply by four</q> function, 
      <m>g(x)=4x</m>. You also learned that you could perform two functions in succession.
      For example, you could perform the <q>add three</q> function on the number <m>1</m> and then 
      perform the <q>multiply by 4</q> function on the result. 
      <me>
        1 \overset{x+3}{\rightarrow} 4  \overset{4x}{\rightarrow} 16
      </me>
      In function notation, we may write <m>g(f(1))=g(1+3)=g(4)=4(4)=16</m> where we perform 
      the inner function first. We may also perform these operations on a generic value <m>x</m>:
      <me>g(f(x))=g(x+3)=4(x+3)=4x+12.</me> We note the importance of order. If we multiply by 4
      first and add 3 second, we get a different result:
      <me>f(g(x))=f(4x)=(4x)+3=4x+3.</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We now explore what happens when we compose geometric transformations. We could compose any 
      two transformations, but we will first focus on reflections. What happens when we perform 
      two or more reflections in succession? Do we get another reflection? Does it matter whether 
      the lines are parallel? Does the order in which we perform the reflections matter?

        A <term>composition</term> of two transformations is a sequence of two transformations, 
        <m>S</m> and <m>T</m>, performed 
        in succession. To find the image of a point <m>P</m> under the composition, <m>S</m> 
        followed by <m>T</m>, written <m>t(s(P))</m>, one first finds the image <m>P'</m>
        of <m>P</m> under the action of <m>s</m> and then finds the image <m>P"</m> of  
        <m>P'</m> under <m>t</m>.
        <me>
          P \overset{s}\rightarrow s(P)=P' \overset{t}\rightarrow t(P')=P''.

        <p>
          First explore what happens when you reflect an object first over line <m>g</m>
          and then over line <m>h</m>  where <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> are parallel. 
          
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
          Use the <sq>reflect across line</sq> tool 
          that looks like a red and blue dot on opposite sides of a diagonal line. 
          Select the tool, select the pentomino, and then select the line. 
          When you reflect across the second line <m>h</m> be sure to reflect the new 
          pentomino <m>A'B'C'D'E'F'</m>, not the original.  Geogebra should label the 
          vertices of the final object with <m>A'', B'', </m>, 
          etc. You may choose to hide (use show/hide tool) the intermediate objects or color 
          the initial and final objects (use right-click on the interior of the pentomino)
          so that it is easier to focus on the first and final figures.

        Is the composition of two isometries always an isometry?  What type?  
        The chart will be useful in answering these questions!  Fill it out to the best of your ability 
        now even if youâ€™re not 100% certain of your answers.  You will have a chance to revise and add to this 
        chart later.
