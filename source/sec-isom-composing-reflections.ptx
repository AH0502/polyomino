  <title>Compositions of Reflections</title>
<subsection>
    <title>Compositions</title>
    <p>
      Each of the transformations we have studied so far, reflections, translations, and rotations, 
      performs an action on the points of the plane. In fact, a transformation is a <term>function</term>
      where the inputs and outputs are geometric objects instead of numbers. In algebra, you learned 
      about the <q>add three</q> function, written <m>f(x)=x+3</m>, and the <q>multiply by four
      </q> function, <m>g(x)=4x</m>. You also learned that you could perform two functions in succession.
      For example, you could perform the <q>add three</q> function on the number <m>1</m> and then 
      perform the <q>multiply by 4</q> function on the result. 
      <me>
        1 \overset{x+3}{\rightarrow} 4  \overset{4x}{\rightarrow} 16
      </me>
      In function notation, we may write <m>g(f(1))=g(1+3)=g(4)=4(4)=16</m> where we perform 
      the inner function first. We may also perform these operations on a generic value <m>x</m>:
      <me>g(f(x))=g(x+3)=4(x+3)=4x+12.</me> We note the importance of order. If we multiply by 4
      first and add 3 second, we get a different result:
      <me>f(g(x))=f(4x)=(4x)+3=4x+3.</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We now explore what happens when we compose geometric transformations. We could compose any 
      two transformations, but we will first focus on reflections. What happens when we perform 
      two or more reflections in succession? Do we get another reflection? Does it matter whether 
      the lines are parallel? Does the order in which we perform the reflections matter?

      <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>composition</term> of two transformations is a sequence of two transformations, 
        <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>, performed 
        in succession. To find the image of a point <m>P</m> under the composition, <m>s</m> 
        followed by <m>t</m>, written <m>t(s(P))</m>, one first finds the image <m>P'</m>
        of <m>P</m> under the action of <m>s</m> and then finds the image <m>P''</m> of  
        <m>P'</m> under <m>t</m>.
        <me>
          P \overset{s}\rightarrow s(P)=P' \overset{t}\rightarrow t(P')=P''.
        </me>
        Note that in the composition <m>P \rightarrow s(t(P))</m>, we perform the inside function 
        <m>t</m> before the outer function <m>s</m>.
      </p>

    <aside>
      <p>
        We can also use the notation <m>t\circ s</m> to represent the composition of <m>t</m> 
        composed with <m>s</m>. It's action on point <m>P</m> is written <m>t(s(P))</m>.

            Each type of isometry has a special object or two that helps to determine it precisely.  
            As shown in <xref ref="table-def-obj-2"/>, a reflection has a reflecting line, a 
            translation has a vector, and a rotation has a center 
            and angle.  Identify and draw in the specific line, vector, or center and angle for this
