    <title>Transformations</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
        Are you aware that animated movies and computer graphics use a lot of mathematics
        and geometry? The images are moved by moving key points to new locations on the screen and 
        the screen. The process of moving each point in the Euclidean plane to a new, possibly the same, point
        is called a <term>transformation</term>. Every point is assigned a 
        single landing position; no point 
        is sent to more than one position by a single transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since it is impossible to show the action of a transformation on every 
      point in the plane, we typically will view how a transformation affects a 
      given figure. The images below show two examples of the effect of transformations on 
      the pentomino <m>ABCDEFGH</m>.

            point outside the pentomino is shown in blue.

            is a larger copy of the original shown in blue. It has been reflected across a 
            line and enlarged by a factor of 1.5.

      The first image shows a transformation which moves objects by a rotation but 
      does not change any lengths or angle measures. We say that it preserves distance 
      and shape. The transformation illustrated in the second image preserves shape  
      but not distance.
