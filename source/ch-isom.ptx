    <title>Isomorphisms</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
        Are you aware that animated movies and computer graphics use a lot of mathematics
        and geometry? The images are moved by moving key points to new locations on the screen and 
        the screen. The process of moving each point in the Euclidean plane to a new, possibly the same, point
        is called a <term>transformation</term>. Every point is assignment a single landing position; no point 
        is sent to more than one position by a single transformation.
    </p>

<p>
    A <term>reflection</term> is the first transformation we will explore. Each reflection is defined by a 
    mirror line and the reflection takes each point to its reflected image. If we were to fold the plane across
    the mirror line, the points and their images would fall on top of each other.

        <p>
        What to expect in this class: Talk about the focus on the why behind the how. 
        Discuss benefits of open-ended exploration. Mention the use of our toolkit.

        <exercise>
          <statement>
            <p> What is the derivative of <m>f(x)=\frac{x^2+1}{x}</m>? </p>
          </statement>
          <hint>
            <p>
              Rewrite the fraction before taking the derivative.
