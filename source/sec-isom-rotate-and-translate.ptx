    <title>What do we mean by orientation-maintaining?</title>
        <p>
            The picture shows a triangle <m>\Delta ABC</m> reflected across a line <m>\ell</m>. Although the 
            letters <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> are in alphabetical order when read clockwise from the 
            original figure, the letters in the reflected image <m>\Delta A'B'C'</m> are in the reverse order. 
            When this happens, we say that the transformation <term>reverses orientation</term>. Any reflection
            will be an <term>orientation-reversing</term> transformation.

            Not all transformations change orientation. In this section, you 
            will encounter two types of <term>orientation-maintaining</term>  
            transformations, namely rotations and translations. When either of 
            these transformations is performed, the order in which the vertices 
            are read is unchanged.
        </p>
        <aside>
            <p>
                Many textbooks use <term>orientation-reversing</term> and <term>
                orientation-preserving</term>. Because of the similarity in the words,
                reversing and preserving, I have chosen to use the term 
                orientation-maintaining instead of orientation-preserving.

                    A geometrical transformation is said to <term>maintain orientation</term> if  
                    when it acts on any polygon the order of the vertices of the 
                    resulting image, read in clockwise order, are the same as that of  
                    the original figure. Another term for orientation-maintaining is 
                    <term>orientation-preserving</term>.

                <p>
                    On the other hand, if the resulting images have the vertices in 
                    the reverse order, we say that the transformation <term>reverses

    <p>
        We observed that although reflections reverse orientation, they <term>preserve</term>
        distance, angle measure, and shape; any object and its image under a 
        reflection are congruent. In <xref ref="fig-illustrate-collineation"/>, 
        we see the action of the reflection across line <m>\overleftrightarrow{HI}</m>
        not just on triangle <m>\Delta ABC</m>, but on other points on the plane.
        Note how points <m>D</m> and <m>E</m> lie on <m>\overleftrightarrow{AC}</m>
        and their reflected images <m>D'</m> and <m>E'</m> lie on the image 
        <m>\overleftrightarrow{AC}</m> of <m>\overleftrightarrow{AC}</m>.
        This suggests that this reflection, and in fact any reflection, should 
        <term>preserve linearity</term> of points.

                A collineation is called an <term>isomorphism</term> if it preserves

        In <xref ref="explor-isom-RAT-translation"/>, we observed many of the properties of a 
        transformation called a <term>translation</term>. <idx><h>translation</h></idx>
        Each translation is uniquely defined by a <term>translation vector</term><fn>A <term>vector</term>
        is simply a directed line segment between two points.</fn> which indicates 
        the direction and distance that every point is moved by the translation. The choice of the translation
        vector, on the other hand, is not unique. Any vector of the same length which points in the same 
        direction may serve as the vector for the translation. In <xref ref="app-translate-wcoords"/>, 
        the vector <m>\overrightarrow{BB'}</m> is a translation vector for the 
        given translation; however, <m>\overrightarrow{AA'}</m>, <m>\overrightarrow{CC'}</m>,
        <m>\overrightarrow{DD'}</m>, or even your <m>\overrightarrow{MM'}</m> 
        would describe the same translation. Any of these vectors
        may be chosen as the translation vector for this translation. 
        You probably noticed that these vectors were parallel 
        and had the same length.

            The third transformation we will consider is a <term>rotation</term>. Like a translation, 
            a rotation maintains the orientation of the vertices.  Each rotation has a single point, 
            called the <term>center</term> of the rotation, which is not moved by the rotation.  
            All other points are rotated around the center a specific number of 
            degrees. A good way to visualize a rotation is to imagine putting a 
            pin through the center and moving the 
            paper around that pin.

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-isom-RAT-props-rotation">
        <title>Properties of Rotations</title>
    <p>
        A rotation is specified by two pieces of information, namely its center and the angle of rotation.  
        The center is the one point which does not move and forms the vertex for the rotation angle.  
        The distance between the center and each point does not change under the rotation, 
        but the direction from the center to each point is changed according to the rotation angle. 
        Normally we think of a positive rotation moving each point <m>P</m> to its image <m>P’</m> in the 
        counterclockwise direction. On the other hand, a rotational angle with 
        negative degree measure would move the image 
        clockwise around the center. Rotational angles may be greater than 180 degrees or negative; 
        in fact, any number of degrees is allowed!
