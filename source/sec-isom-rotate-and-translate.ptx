            The picture shows a triangle <m>\Delta ABC</m> reflected across a line <m>\ell</m>. Although the 
            letters <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> are in alphabetical order when read clockwise from the 
            original figure, the letters in the reflected image <m>\Delta A'B'C'</m> are in the reverse order. 
            When this happens, we say that the transformation <term>reverses orientation</term>. Any reflection
            will be an orientation-reversing transformation.

            these is performed, the order in which the vertices are read is unchanged.

        <title>Properties of Translations</title>
    <p>
        In <xref ref="expl-translation"/>, we observed many of the properties of a 
        transformation called a <term>translation</term>. <idx><h>translation</h></idx>
        Each translation is uniquely defined by a <term>translation vector</term><fn>A <term>vector</term>
        is simply a directed line segment between two points.</fn> which indicates 
        the direction and distance that every point is moved by the translation. The choice of the translation
        vector, on the other hand, is not unique. Any vector of the same length which points in the same 
        direction may serve as the vector for the translation. In <xref ref="translated-triangle"/>, the vector 
        <m>\overrightarrow{BB'}</m> is a translation vector for the given translation; however, <m>\overrightarrow{AA'}</m>,
        <m>\overrightarrow{CC'}</m>, or even your <m>\overrightarrow{EE'}</m> would describe the same translation. Any of these
        may be chosen as the translation vector for this translation. You probably noticed that these were parallel 
        and the same length.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, we observed that the translation preserved orientation, distance, angle measure, and shape. When you
        chose a random point on <m>\overline{BC}</m>, its image landed on <m>\overline{B'C'}</m>, suggesting

        <title>Properties of Rotations</title>
    <p>
        A rotation is specified by two pieces of information, namely its center and the angle of rotation.  
        The center is the one point which does not move and forms the vertex for the rotation angle.  
        A good way to visualize a rotation is to imagine putting a thumbtack through the center and moving the 
        paper around that center.  The distance between the center and each point does not change under the rotation, 
        but the direction from the center to each point is changed according to the rotation angle. 
        Normally we think of a positive rotation moving each point <m>P</m> to its image <m>P’</m> in the 
        counterclockwise direction. Thus, a rotational angle with negative degree measure would move the image 
        clockwise around the center. Rotational angles may be greater than 180 degrees or negative; 
        in fact, any number of degrees is allowed!
