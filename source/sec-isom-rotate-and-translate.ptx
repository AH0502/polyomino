            The picture shows a triangle <m>\Delta ABC</m> reflected across a line <m>\ell</m>. Although the 
            letters <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> are in alphabetical order when read clockwise from the 
            original figure, the letters in the reflected image <m>\Delta A'B'C'</m> are in the reverse order. 
            When this happens, we say that the transformation <term>reverses orientation</term>. Any reflection
            will be an orientation-reversing transformation.

            Not all transformations reverse orientation. In this section, you will encounter two types
            of <term>orientation-preserving</term> transformations: rotations and translations. When either of 
            these is performed, the order in which the vertices are read is unchanged.

        <p>
            In the next exploration, you are given a picture of an object and its image under a translation.
            As you complete the tasks, think about what properties a translation must have and how one might 
            describe a specific translation.

                    We call the isometry in <xref ref="translated-triangle"/> a translation. Describe in your 
                    own words how a translation acts on points in the plane.

        In <xref ref="expl-translation"/>, we observed many of the properties of a 
        transformation called a <term>translation</term>. <idx><h>translation</h></idx>
        Each translation is uniquely defined by a <term>translation vector</term><fn>A <term>vector</term>
        is simply a directed line segment between two points.</fn> which indicates 
        the direction and distance that every point is moved by the translation. The choice of the translation
        vector, on the other hand, is not unique. Any vector of the same length which points in the same 
        direction may serve as the vector for the translation. In <xref ref="translated-triangle"/>, the vector 
        <m>\overrightarrow{BB'}</m> is a translation vector for the given translation; however, <m>\overrightarrow{AA'}</m>,
        <m>\overrightarrow{CC'}</m>, or even your <m>\overrightarrow{EE'}</m> would describe the same translation. Any of these
        may be chosen as the translation vector for this translation. You probably noticed that these were parallel 
        and the same length.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, we observed that the translation preserved orientation, distance, angle measure, and shape. When you
        chose a random point on <m>\overline{BC}</m>, its image landed on <m>\overline{B'C'}</m>, suggesting 
        that a translation should <term>preserve linearity</term> of points. A transformation that preserves 
        linearity, that takes collinear points to collinear points, is called a <term>collineation</term>.

    <title>Rotations</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            The third transformation we will consider is a <term>rotation</term>. Like a translation, 
            a rotation preserves the orientation of the vertices.  Each rotation has a single point, 
            called the <term>center</term> of the rotation, which is not moved by the rotation.  
            All other points are rotated around the center a specific number of degrees.
