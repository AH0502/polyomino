    <title>Notes for <xref ref="sec-isom-reflect-Cartesian"/></title>
    <p>
      The author is happy to provide a pdf-version of the activities in this section. 
      <!--NOTE TO SELF: 
      MAKE SURE TYPO on p.2 part b is CORRECTED (y-axis not x-axis).--> Be sure to 
      check that students correctly sketch the reflection in <xref ref="drawreflection"/>. 
      Reflecting across a diagonal line is more challenging for some students. 
      Encourage students to compare 
      their sketches with others and discuss if there are different sketches. 
      Miras (math education supply stores) or  small 
      mirrors (craft stores) can be effective at resolving differences 
      and helping students visualize, but I recommend letting them draw the 
      reflection first without these aids.
      
      Although much of this chapter will be done with GeoGebra apps, it is worthwhile 
      to have students do this first activity on paper in small groups. Performing 
      actions by hand gives deeper understanding, encourages teamwork, and introduces 
      some properties of reflections in the coordinate plane across the <m>x</m>-axis,
      <m>y</m>-axis, and lines <m>y=x</m> and <m>y=-x</m>. In preparation for this lesson, print out copies of the illustrations in 
      this section, bring enough reddish, greenish, and blueish pencils so 
      each group can have at least one of each color. Should students draw in the 
      wrong color, they can indicate the color they used by making a mark in the text.

      In <xref ref="disc-prop-reflection-perp-bis"/>, students should discover that 
      the reflecting line is the perpendicular bisector of each segment joining a 
      point in the original figure with its image. The task also reminds students that 
      the diagonal of a 1x1-square has length <m>\sqrt{2}</m>. In 
      <xref ref="disc-prop-reflect-findline"/>, students should use what they learned 
      to draw the reflecting line. If their line is off, encourage them to fold along 
      their line to check their work and consider what they might do. This type of task 
      will appear more later in the chapter. Keep it at an exploratory level at this point.
      Note that we have not learned how to draw a perpendicular bisector. An optional 
      exploration MAYBE AN EXERCISE might be to discover how to use folding to create 
      these. Current plans are to add a chapter on constructions, but probably 
      later in the text. <xref ref="ref-acrossxtheny"/> gives an introduction to 
      composition of reflections, a topic which will be explored in depth in 
      <xref ref="sec-isom-composing-reflections"/>.

      Note that students may be uncomfortable with the notation for compositions,
      especially the fact that <m>f\circ g(x)=f(g(x))</m>. Students are used to 
      performing computations from left to right. The author has debated whether to 
      be consistent with composition notation or to use a new symbol that would 
      facilitate a left-to-right method. This may change in future versions. Let me 
      know what you think!

      In <xref ref="explor-refl-two-intersecting"/>, students should definitely be 
      encouraged to hide <m>A'B'C'D'E'F'</m> as well as its vertices. The rotational 
      angle is double the angle between the lines. Reversing the order in which 
      points for the angle are selected may give measurements that make the doubling 
      more obvious.

      This section gives an opportunity for students to apply their learning 
      from this chapter in a fun challenge.

    <title>Notes for <xref ref="sec-isom-symmetry"/></title>
  <p>
    The beginning of this section connects the notion of symmetry with the 
    isomorphisms of this chapter. In the next chapter, we will connect 
    dilations to similarity. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The subsection <xref ref="subsec-symm-transformations"/> at the end of this 
    section may be omitted or given as an extension for students who appreciate 
    the challenge. Here, students will build a group table for compositions of 
    symmetries of an equilateral table. Completion of this subsection provides a 
    context for a discussion of algebraic properties like the commutative law, 
    identity properties, and inverse properties.
